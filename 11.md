# Section 11

1. *Quoniam ad hunc locum perventum est, non alienum esse videtur de Galliae
   Germaniaeque moribus et quo differant hae nationes inter sese proponere.*

   Since he has come to this location, it seems to be convinient to explain of the
   customs of the Gaul and Germans and to explain by what these nations differ
   amongst themselves.

2. *In Gallia non solum in omnibus civitatibus atque in omnibus pagis
   partibusque sed paene etiam in singulis domibus factiones sunt,*

   In Gaul not only in all states and in all districts and fathers but also in
   almost each home there are factiones,

3. *earumque factionum principes sunt, qui summam auctoritatem eorum iudicio
   habere existimantur quorum ad arbitrium iudiciumque summa omnium rerum
   consiliorumque redeat.* 

   and of those factions there are leaders, who are thought to hold the highest
   authority of them to judgement, of the sort who the highest of all events and
   plans return to their decision and judgement.

4. *Itaque eius rei causa antiquitus institutem videtur, ne quis ex plebe contra
   potentiorem auxili egeret: suos enim quisque opprimi et circumveniri non
   patitur neque, aliter si faciat, ullum inter suos habet auctoritatem.*

   and so the cause of this affair seems an ancient institution, that not any out
   of the common people should lack aid againt a more powerful one: and indeed not
   any allows those to be oppresses and defrauded, otherwise if he does he does not
   have any authority among them.

5. *Haec eadem ratio est in summa totius Galliae: namque omnes civitates in
   partes divisae sunt duas.*

   This is the same method in the highest whole of Gaul and for all the states are
   divided into two factions.
