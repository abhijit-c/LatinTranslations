      way tree may hold them with its being in leaf hospitality.

| *aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga subegit.*

| *pulveris exigui iactu compressa quiescent.*

      no thicker is hail from the sky, nor to such a extent does it rain of acorns
      from the shaken oak: In the midst of the battle-lines the chiefs themselves,
      with resplendent wings, turn over great souls in their small hearts, ever
      steadfast not to yield, until the heavy victor drives under either this or this
      to turn their backs in flight.  These movements of the spririts, these contests
      of such size, they will be kept quiet, having been compressed, by a toss of
      a little dust.

      But when you have called both captains from the battle-line, give to death he
      that seemed worse, lest the wasteful one is a nuisance, allow the better reign
      in the hall alone.  The one will be shining with rough spots of gold; for there
      are two kinds: this better one, noble of expression and bright with red scales; 

- to finish

| *ut binae regum facies, ita corpora plebis.*
| *namque aliae turpes horrent, ceu pulvere ab alto*
| *cum venit et sicco terram spuit ore viator*
| *aridus; elucent aliae et fulgore coruscant*
| *ardentes auro et paribus lita corpora guttis.*
| *haec potior suboles, hinc caeli tempore certo*
| *dulcia mella premes, nec tantum dulcia quantum*
| *et liquida et durum Bacchi domitura saporem.*

      As the features of the kings are twofold, so are the bodies of the
      subject.

      For some ugly ones tremble, as when the thirsty traveler comes from the deep
      dust, and spits earth from his dried mouth.

      Other gleam, and flash in
      lightning bolt, their bodies all ablaze and flecked with equal specks of gold. 

| *At cum incerta volant caeloque examina ludunt*
| *contemnuntque favos et frigida tecta relinquunt,*
| *instabilis animos ludo prohibebis inani.*
| *nec magnus prohibere labor: tu regibus alas*
| *eripe; non illis quisquam cunctantibus altum*
| *ire iter aut castris audebit vellere signa.*
| *invitent croceis halantes floribus horti*
| *et custos furum atque avium cum falce saligna*
| *Hellespontiaci servet tutela Priapi.*
| *ipse thymum pinosque ferens de montibus altis*
| *tecta serat late circum cui talia curae;*
| *ipse labore manum duro terat, ipse feracis*
| *figat humo plantas et amicos inriget imbris.*
| *Atque equidem, extremo ni iam sub fine laborum*
| *vela traham et terris festinem advertere proram,*
| *forsitan et pinguis hortos quae cura colendi*
| *ornaret canerem, biferique rosaria Paesti,*
| *quoque modo potis gauderent intiba rivis*
| *et virides apio ripae, rtusque per herbam*
| *cresceret in ventrem cucumis; nec sera comantem*
| *narcissum aut flexi tacuissem vimen acanthi*
| *pallentisque hederas et amantis litora myrtos.*
