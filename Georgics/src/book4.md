| *ferre domum prohibent) neque oves haedique petulci* 10
| *floribus insultent, aut errans bucula campo*
| *decutiat rorem et surgentis atterat herbas.*

- Note *surgentis* is accusative alternate ending, which you can ascertain by
  meter it must be *īs*, not *is*.

      having been marked with respect to her breast by bloody hands.

      way tree may hold them with its being in leaf hospitality.

| *transversas salices et grandia conice saxa,*

      if by chance the headlong East wind will have scattered those staying or
      will have plunged them with Neptune.

      bees.

      Nor in vain do those (bees) earnestly smear the thin vents in their house
      with wax, and fill the edges with dye and flowers, and they preserve glue,
      having been collected for this very duty, more clinging than both
      bird-lime and the tar of the Phrygian Ida.

  indicative, meaning to maintain.
- *effossis latebris* is an ablative of absolute.

      having been dug out under the earth, and were discovered deep in both in
      a hollow pumice stone and a having been hollowed cave of a tree.

- Long string of imperative, *sine, ure, crede*, i.e. to allow, burn, and trust.
- *odor* and *gravis* are connected via an implied *est* as predicate
  nominative.
- *pulsu* is the second supine denoting respect.

      Neither permit a yew near their dwelling, nor burn red crabs with the
      hearth, nor trust a deep marsh, or where the the scent of mud is heavy or
      where the hollow stones emit sounds when being struck and the having been
      struck voice's echo reverberates.

| *Quod superest, ubi pulsam hiemem Sol aureus egit*

| *purpureosque metunt flores et flumina libant*
| *summa leves.* 55

- *superest* means to be left over, combining with adverbial *quod* meaning with

      That which left over, when the golden sun has driven the having been
      beaten winter under the earth and has opened heaven with its summer light,
      immediately those (bees) scour the glades and forests and reap purple
      flowers and they delicately sip the top of rivers.

|              *hinc nescio qua dulcedine laetae*
| *progeniem nidosque fovent, hinc arte recentis*
| *excudunt ceras et mella tenacia fingunt.*

- *hinc* as from now on, see notes.
- *arte* literally with art, notes say skillyfully.

      From now on, I do not know with what sweetness, they cherish the nest and
      family, from now on they skillfully fashion fresh wax and mould clinging
      honey.

| *hinc ubi iam emissum caveis ad sidera caeli*
| *nare per aestatem liquidam suspexeris agmen*
| *obscuramque trahi vento mirabere nubem,* 60
| *contemplator:*

- Why is *suspexeris* either perfect or future perfect? Doesn't seem to flow.
- *per aestatem liquidam* translated as through the clear summer air, see notes.
- *trahi* is the passive infinitive, but I don't like my translation.
- *contemplator* is watch carefully, see notes.

      From now on when you will look up to the swarm now having been expeled
      from the hollow toward the stars of the sky through the clear summer air
      and you will be amazed at the dark cloud to be drawn by the wind, watch
      carefully.

|               *aquas dulcis et frondes semper*
| *tecta perunt, huc tu iussos asperge sapores,*
| *trita melisphylla et cerinthae ignobile gramen,*
| *tinnitusque cie et Matris quate cymbala circum:*

      they are ever in quest of sweet waters and leafy coverts. Here scatter the
      scents I prescribe – bruised balm, and the honeywort’s lowly herb; raise
      a tinkling sound, and shake the Mighty Mother’s cymbals round about. 

| *ipsae consident medicatis sedibus, ipsae* 65
| *intima more suo sese in cunabula condent.*

      Of themselves they settle on the scented resting places; of themselves,
      after their wont, will hide far within their cradling cells.

| *Sin autem ad pugnam exierint nam saepe duobus*
| *regibus incessit magno discordia motu;*

      But, if haply for battle they have gone forth – for strife with terrible
      turmoil has often fallen on two kings; 

| *continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello*
| *corda licet longe praesciscere: namque morantis* 70
| *Martius ille aeris rauci canor increpat, et vox*
| *auditur fractos sonitus imitata tubarum;*

      and straightway you may presage from afar the fury of the crowd, and how
      their hearts thrill with war; for the warlike ring of the hoarse clarion
      stirs the loiterers, and a sound is heard that is like broken trumpet
      blasts.

| *tum trepidae inter se coeunt pennisque coruscant*
| *spiculaque exacuunt rostris aptantque lacertos*
| *et circa regem atque ipsa ad praetoria densae* 75

      Then they nervously gather amongst themselves and quiver with their wings
      and sharpen their stings with their beaks and adjust their muscles and
      densly they are embroiled around the king and near the general's tent and
      they call the enemy with great cries.

| *ergo ubi ver nactae sudum camposque patentis,*
| *erumpunt portis;*

  meaning to obtain/get.

      forth from their gates;

|                  *concurritur, aethere in alto*
| *fit sonitus, magnum mixtae glomerantur in orbem*
| *praecipitesque cadunt;*

      there is a flocking together, in the high sky a loud sound is made, they,
      having been mingled, are amassed into a great sphere and they headlong
      plummet.

|                        *non densior aëre grando,* 80
| *nec de concussa tantum pluit ilice glandis:*
| *ipsi per medias acies insignibus alis*
| *ingentis animos angusto in pectore versant,*
| *usque adeo obnixi non cedere dum gravis aut hos*
| *aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga subegit.* 85
| *hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta*
| *pulveris exigui iactu compressa quiescent.*

      no thicker is hail from the sky, nor to such a extent does it rain of acorns
      from the shaken oak: In the midst of the battle-lines the chiefs themselves,
      with resplendent wings, turn over great souls in their small hearts, ever
      steadfast not to yield, until the heavy victor drives under either this or this
      to turn their backs in flight.  These movements of the spririts, these contests
      of such size, they will be kept quiet, having been compressed, by a toss of
      a little dust.

| *Verum ubi ductores acie revocaveris ambo,*
| *deterior qui visus, eum, ne prodigus obsit,*
| *dede neci; melior vacua sine regnet in aula.* 90
| *alter erit maculis auro squalentibus ardens;*
| *nam duo sunt genera: hic melior insignis et ore*

| *et rutilis clarus squamis; ille horridus alter*
| *desidia latamque trahens inglorius alvum.*

      But when you have called both captains from the battle-line, give to death he
      that seemed worse, lest the wasteful one is a nuisance, allow the better reign
      in the hall alone.  The one will be shining with rough spots of gold; for there
      are two kinds: this better one, noble of expression and bright with red scales; 

| *ut binae regum facies, ita corpora plebis.* 95

      As the features of the kings are twofold, so are the bodies of the
      subject.

| *namque aliae turpes horrent, ceu pulvere ab alto*
| *cum venit et sicco terram spuit ore viator*
| *aridus; elucent aliae et fulgore coruscant*
| *ardentes auro et paribus lita corpora guttis.*

      For some ugly ones tremble, as when the thirsty traveler comes from the
      deep dust, and spits earth from his dried mouth.  Other gleam, and flash
      with lightning, their bodies all ablaze and flecked with equal specks
      of gold. 

| *haec potior suboles, hinc caeli tempore certo* 100
| *dulcia mella premes, nec tantum dulcia quantum*
| *et liquida et durum Bacchi domitura saporem.*

- Implied *est* on *haec...suboles*.
- *certo* as appointed see notes.
- *tantum...quantum* is a coordinating conjunction meaning as much...as.
- Implied *sunt* on *domitura* turning it into the active periphrastic, which
  denotes a future or intended action.

      This is the better race, from these you will press sweet honeys during the
      appointed season of the sky, nor so much sweet as to both be clear and
      intended to subdue the harsh flavor of wine.

| *At cum incerta volant caeloque examina ludunt*
| *contemnuntque favos et frigida tecta relinquunt,*
| *instabilis animos ludo prohibebis inani.* 105

- Note *incerta* and *caelo* don't match in gender, and therefore cannot match
  in the ablative.
- *frigida* is in the proleptic use, see notes.
- Note that *prohibebis* is future and being used as a placeholder for
  imperative.

      But when the uncertain swarms fly and play in the sky and pay no heed to
      their honeycomb and abandon their houses to get cold, you will restrain
      their unsteady mind from inane play.

| *nec magnus prohibere labor: tu regibus alas*
| *eripe; non illis quisquam cunctantibus altum*
| *ire iter aut castris audebit vellere signa.*

- Jesus Vergil, chill with your bee abuse.
- Implied impersonal *est* connecting *magnus labor*.
- *iter* as aloft, see notes.

      Nor is it a great labor to restrain them: snatch away the wings from the
      kings; No one from those hesitating kings will dare to go aloft or pluck
      the battle standard from the camps.

| *invitent croceis halantes floribus horti*
| *et custos furum atque avium cum falce saligna* 110
| *Hellespontiaci servet tutela Priapi.*

- Subjunctives here are hortatory.
- Genitive as against, see notes. Objective genitive.

      Let gardens being fragrant with golden flowers invite them and let the
      guard against thieves and birds, protector of Hellespontia Priapus,
      watch over them with his willow sickle.

| *ipse thymum pinosque ferens de montibus altis*
| *tecta serat late circum cui talia curae;*
| *ipse labore manum duro terat, ipse feracis*
| *figat humo plantas et amicos inriget imbris.* 115

- Note on *et...imbris* here makes no sense, *amicos* is accusative.

      Let he to whom the concerns are such, himself, bringing thyme and pine
      from the high mountains, plant them around their homes; 
      let he himself wear out his hand with hard labor, himself fasten fruitful
      cuttings in the ground and let him water the friendly streams.

| *Atque equidem, extremo ni iam sub fine laborum*
| *vela traham et terris festinem advertere proram,*
| *forsitan et pinguis hortos quae cura colendi*
| *ornaret canerem, biferique rosaria Paesti,*
| *quoque modo potis gauderent intiba rivis* 120
| *et virides apio ripae, tortusque per herbam*
| *cresceret in ventrem cucumis;*

- *sub* and *fine* seem superfluous, will ignore one? Notes, save me! NOO!
- Note *canderem* is imperfect. Why is this mixed like this? I don't know!
- Note makes no sense on *protis...rivis*. Drinking? *potis* is a p.p.p if
  anything.

      and indeed, if I were not under the extreme edge of my labor, dragging my
      sails and hastening to turn the prow to land, perhaps I might also sing of
      what care of cultivating decorates rich gardens and of the twice-blooming
      roses of Paestum, and in what manner the endives are glad with the having
      been drunk streams and the banks green with celery are glad, and in what
      manner the cucumber having been twisted through the grass comes forth
      into it's belly.

|                               *nec sera comantem*
| *narcissum aut flexi tacuissem vimen acanthi*
| *pallentisque hederas et amantis litora myrtos.*

- The *amantis* turns the noun *litora* into a *adjective* describing the
  *Mrytles*.

      Nor would I have been silent about the late-flowering narcissus or the
      twig of the having been bent bear's foot and the pale ivy and the
      shore-loving Mrytles.

| *namque sub Oebaliae memini me turribus arcis,* 125
| *qua niger umectat flaventia culta Galaesus,*
| *Corycium vidisse senem, cui pauca relicti*
| *iugera ruris erant, nec fertilis illa iuvencis*
| *nec pecori opportuna seges nec commoda Baccho.*

- *memini* from *memini, meminisse* is 1st singular perfect active indicative,
  meaning to recall. Recall, perfect form present force.
- *Galaesus* is a river.
- The Corycian Cave is located on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, in central
  Greece. The Cilicians were famous gardeners.
- *cui* dative of possesor fitting on the *erant*.
- *jugerum* is a 240x120' rectangle of land.

      For I recall that under the towers of a Spartan citadel, where the dark
      Galaesus waters the golden cultivated land, I saw an old Corycian man,
      who had a few jugerum of having been abandoned country, those (are) not
      fertile for young bulls nor opportune for grain fields nor convinient for wine.

| *hic rarum tamen in dumis olus albaque circum* 130
| *lilia verbenasque premens vescumque papaver*
| *regum aequabat opes animis, seraque revertens*
| *nocte domum dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis.*

- This whole first 3 lines is an appositive fitting onto *regum...animis*.
- Treating *revertens* as imperfect, see notes.

      Nevertheless he, planting here scattered vegetables and white lilies and
      vervains and thin poppies around in the thorns, was equaling the prides of
      kings, and returning home at late night he was loading his table with
      an unbought feast.

| *primus vere rosam atque autumno carpere poma,*
| *et cum tristis hiems etiamnum frigore saxa* 135
| *rumperet et glacie cursus frenaret aquarum,*
| *ille comam mollis iam tondebat hyacinthi*
| *aestatem increpitans seram Zephyrosque morantis.*

- *carpere* as historical infinitive.
- Both *rumperet* and *frenaret* are imperfect subjunctives, fitting inside
  *cum* implying *cum* clause. Likely circumstancial. Could be concessive too.

      First in the spring he was gathering roses and in the fall he was
      gathering apples, and although sorrowful winter was even now breaking
      stones with it's cold and restraining the courses of the rivers with its
      ice, that man was already cutting the hair of the soft hyacinthus, chiding
      late summer and the delaying West-winds.

| *ergo apibus fetis idem atque examine multo*
| *primus abundare et spumantia cogere pressis* 140
| *mella favis; illi tiliae atque uberrima pinus,*
| *quotque in flore novo pomis se fertilis arbos*
| *induerat totidem autumno matura tenebat.*

      Therefore the same man was the first to abound with bees honey-crammed and
      a large swarm and to collect the foaming honey from having been pressed
      honeycomb; Those lime and pine trees were very fertile, and the fertile
      tree had been covered with so many fruits in it's new blossom, just as
      many ripe fruits were preserving in the autumn.

| *ille etiam seras in versum distulit ulmos*
| *eduramque pirum et spinos iam pruna ferentis* 145
| *iamque ministrantem platanum potantibus umbras.*

He would also plant out elms in rows, though late in season, pears when quite hard, blackthorns already hung with sloes, and planes already offering to drinkers the service of their shade

| *verum haec ipse equidem spatiis exclusus iniquis*
| *praetereo atque aliis post me memoranda relinquo.*

But all this I must pass by, constrained by narrow bounds, and leave to others after me to record.

| *Nunc age, naturas apibus quas Iuppiter ipse*
| *addidit expediam, pro qua mercede canoros* 150
| *Curetum sonitus crepitantiaque aera secutae*
| *Dictaeo caeli regem pavere sub antro.*

Come now, the qualities which Jove himself has given bees, I will unfold – even the reward for which they followed the tuneful sounds and clashing bronzes of the Curetes, and fed the king of heaven within the cave of Dicte.

| *solae communis natos, consortia tecta*
| *habent, magnisque agitant sub legibus aevum,*
| *et patriam solae et certos novere penatis;* 155
| *venturacque hiemis memores aestate laborem*
| *experiuntur et in medium quaesita reponunt.*
