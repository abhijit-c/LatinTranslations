# Liber IV

| *Protinvs aërii mellis caelestia dona*
| *exsequar:*

- *exsequar* from *exsequor, exsequi, exsecutus sum* is 1st singular future
  indicative, meaning to follow/carry out.

      Without pause I will relate in order the heavenly gifts of the honey of
      the sky:

|           *hanc etiam, Maecenas, aspice partem.*

- *aspice* from *aspicio, aspicere, aspexi, aspectus* is the present active
  imperative, meaning to see/observe.

      Furthermore, Maecenas, observe this part.

| *admiranda tibi levium spectacula rerum*
| *magnanimosque duces totiusque ordine gentis*
| *mores et studia et populos et proelia dicam.* 5

- *admiranda* from *admiror, admirari, admiratus sum* is the gerundive, meaning
  to admire. This is modifying *spectacula* in the accusative plural case.
- *dicam* from *dico, dicere, dixi, dictus* is 1st singular present active
  subjunctive, meaning to say. Likely some sort of jussive independent usage. 
- Ehh, perhaps not the most elegant or literal way to translate? Bug Rafa about
  it.

      I will in order speak to you of the amazing spectacles of their trivial
      affairs, the brave leaders, customs, enthusiasms, peoples, and the battles
      of entire tribes.

| *in tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria, si quem*
| *numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo.*

- Implied *est* in *in tenui labor* and *at tenuis non gloria*.
- Using the translation of *tenui* as humble from the back of Huxley.
- Before si/nisi/num/ne all the ali- fall away. *si quem = si aliquem*.
- *sinunt* from *sino, sinere, sivi, situs* is 3rd plural present active
  indicative, meaning to allow.
- *audit* from *audio, audire, audivi, auditus* is 3rd singular present active
  indicative, meaning to hear.

      The labor is in the humble thing; but the glory is not humble, if the
      harmful divinities allow anyone and Apollo, having been called, listens.

| *Principio sedes apibus statioque petenda,*
| *quo neque sit ventis aditus (nam pabula venti*
| *ferre domum prohibent) neque oves haedique petulci* 10
| *floribus insultent, aut errans bucula campo*
| *decutiat rorem et surgentis atterat herbas.*

- *petenda* from *peto, petere, petivi, petitus* is the passive periphrastic
  (implied *est*), meaning to seek.
- Note: *sedes statioque* is potentially hendiadys, i.e. a stationary resident?
  Not sure what Huxley is on about.
- Per Huxley, *quo = ut ad eam* and is contrued with *aditus*, which may govern
  a prepositional phrase.
- These sequence of verbs are present, and I know you can translate present
  verbs as *canit* = is singing, so that's what I did. I think it worked.
- *sit* is a final subjunctive, per Huxley.
- *prohibent* from *prohibeo, prohibere, prohibui, prohibitus* is 3rd plural
  present active indicative, meaning to prevent/hinder. This is taking *ferre*
  as a complimentary infinitive.
- *insultent* from *insulto, insultare* is 3rd plural present active
  subjunctive, meaning to leap (in/on), and it takes an ablative (*floribus*).
  Note this is a parallel structure with *sit* as a final clause.
- *decutiat* from *decutio, decutere, decussi, decussus* is 3rd singular present
  active subjunctive, meaning to knock aside. Note this is a parallel structure
  with *sit* as a final clause.
- *atterat* from *attero, atterere, attrivi, attritus* is 3rd singular present
  active subjunctive, meaning to rub. Note this is a parallel structure with
  *sit* as a final clause.
- Note *surgentis* is accusative alternate ending, which you can ascertain by
  meter it must be *īs*, not *is*.

      In the beginning a residence and a station ought to be sought for the
      bees, so that to it neither are there entrences for winds (for the winds
      prevent them to bring their food(s) to home) nor sheep and the butting
      young goats leaping on flowers, or wandering young cow knocking aside dew
      from the plain and wearing away the growing grass.

| *absint et picti squalentia terga lacerti*
| *pinguibus a stabulis, meropesque aliaeque volucres*
| *et manibus Procne pectus signata cruentis;* 15

- *absint* from *absum, abesse, abfui, abfuturus* is 3rd plural present active
  subjunctive, meaning to be away/absent.
- *signata* from *signo, signare, signavi, signatus* is the perfect passive
  participle, meaning to mark/stamp.
- Accusative of respect! Accusative of limitation is this, but Huxley is British
  so we must suffer.

      Let the lizards painted with respect to their scaly backs be removed from
      the rich stalls, and the bee eater and the other birds and Procne
      having been marked with respect to her breast by bloody hands.

| *omnia nam late vastant ipsasque volantis*
| *ore ferunt dulcem nidis immitibus escam.*

- *vastant* from *vasto, vastare* is 3rd plural present active indicative,
  meaning to lay waste/ravage.
- *ferunt* from *fero, ferre, tuli, latus* is 3rd plural present active
  indicative, meaning to bring.

      For all things far and wide ravage the flying things themselves and carry
      off pleasant food with their cruel mouths to their nests.

| *at liquidi fontes et stagna virentia musco*
| *adsint et tenuis fugiens per gramina rivus,*

- *adsint* from *adsum, adesse, adfui, adfuturus* is 3rd plural present active
  subjunctive, meaning to be near/present; aid (w/DAT).
- *fugiens* from *fugio, fugere, fugi, fugitus* is the present active
  participle, meaning to flee.

      but let clear springs and pools becoming green with moss and a thin stream
      fleeing through the grass be present, 

| *palmaque vestibulum aut ingens oleaster inumbret,* 20

- *inumbret* from *inumbro, inumbrare, inumbravi, inumbratus* is 3rd singular
  present active subjunctive, meaning to cast a shadow.

      and let a palm tree or a vast olive-tree cast a shadow on the entrance,

| *ut, cum prima novi ducent examina reges*
| *vere suo, ludetque favis emissa iuventus,*
| *vicina invitet decedere ripa calori,*
| *obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbos.*

- *ducent* from *duco, ducere, duxi, ductus* is 3rd plural future active
  indicative, meaning to lead.
- *ludet* from *ludo, ludere, lusi, lusus* is 3rd singular future active
  indicative, meaning to play.
- Both of these in temporal *cum* clauses.

      so that, when the new kings will lead the first swarms in their own
      spring, and when the youth having been sent out from the honeycombs will
      play, a nearby bank invites them to retire from the heat, and an in the
      way tree may hold them with its being in leaf hospitality.

| *in medium, seu stabit iners seu profluet umor,* 25
| *transversas salices et grandia conice saxa,*
| *pontibus ut crebris possint consistere et alas*
| *pandere ad aestivum solem, si forte morantis*
| *sparserit aut praeceps Neptuno immerserit Eurus.*

- Note says that *in medium* is likely neuter (meaning middle/center) as opposed
  to masculine (meaning mediator/one who stands in the middle). Basically,
  *medius, medii* versus *medium, medi(i)*.
- Note *seu...seu* is a coordinating conjunction meaning 'whether...or'.
- *stabit* from *sto, stare, steti, status* is 3rd singular future active
  indicative, meaning to stand.
- *profluet* from *profluo, profluere, profluxi, profluctus* is 3rd singular
  future active indicative, meaning to flow forth or along.
- *conice* from *conicio, conicere, conieci, coniectus* is the present active
  imperative, meaning to hurl.
- *possint* from *possum, posse, potui* is 3rd plural present active
  subjunctive, meaning to be able.
- *consistere* from *consisto, consistere, constiti, constitus* is the present
  active infinitive, meaning to stop/halt/cease.

  infinitive, meaning to spread out.
- *morantis* from *moror, morari, moratus sum* is the present participle (ACC),
  meaning to delay.
- *sparserit* from *spargo, spargere, sparsi, sparsus* is futp, meaning to
  scatter/sprinkle.
- *immerserit* from *immergo, immergere, immersi, immersus* is futp, meaning to
  drop/plunge.
- *Neptuno* wants to be some kind of locative ablative, i.e. 'in the ocean' like
  the notes say. But I think literally we can take it as accompaniment?

      Into the middle, whether the inert moisture will stand still or will flow
      forth, hurl willow-trees lying across and large stones, so that they are
      able to linger by the numerous bridges and spread out their wings toward
      the summer sun, if by chance the headlong East wind will have scattered
      those staying or will have immersed them with Neptune.

| *haec circum casiae virides et olentia late* 30
| *serpylla et graviter spirantis copia thymbrae*
| *floreat, inriguumque bibant violaria fontem.*

- *floreat* from *floreo, florere, florui* is 3rd singular present active
  subjunctive, meaning to flourish.
- *bibant* from *bibo, bibere, bibi, bibitusu* is 3rd plural present active
  subjunctive, meaning to drink.

      Let this flourish around green spurge-laurels and wild thyme odorous far
      and wide and plenty things deeply exhaling of armotic plants, and let
      a bed of violets drink the moisture-bringing spring.

| *ipsa autem, seu corticibus tibi suta cavatis*
| *seu lento fuerint alvaria vimine texta,*
| *angustos habeant aditus:*

- *suta* from *suo, suere, sui, sutus* is the perfect passive participle,
  meaning to sew together/stitch.
- *fuerint* is 3rd plural perfect active subjunctive.
- *texta* from *texo, texere, texui, textus* is the perfect passive participle,
  meaning to weave.
- *tibi* dative of agent, *corticibus cavatis* and *lento vimine* are ablative
  of means.
- *habeant* from *habeo, habere, habui, habitus* is 3rd plural present active
  subjunctive, meaning to have.

      But, whether the beehives were sown with hollow bark or were woven with
      a clinging twig by you, let them have a narrow entrace.

|                          *nam frigore mella* 35
| *cogit hiems, eademque calor liquefacta remittit -*
| *utraque vis apibus pariter metuenda;*

- *cogit* from *cogo, cogere, coegi, coactus* is 3rd singular present active
  indicative, meaning to collect/gather.
- *remittit* from *remitto, remittere, remisi, remissus* is 3rd singular
  present active indicative, meaning to send back, remit. In Lewis and Short:
  “frigore mella Cogit hiems eademque calor liquefacta remittit,” dissolves again,
  melts, Verg. G. 4, 36;
- *metuenda* from *metuo, metuere, metui* is the passive periphrastic with an
  implied *est*, meaning to fear/be afraid.

      For the winter congeals honey with frost, and heat dissolves the same, having
      been melted - and either power ought to be equally feared by the
      bees.

|                                      *neque illae*
| *nequiquam in tectis certatim tenuia cera*
| *spiramenta linunt, fucoque et floribus oras*
| *explent, collectumque haec ipsa ad munera gluten* 40
| *et visco et Phrygiae servant pice lentius Idae.*

- *linunt* from *lino, linere, levi, litus* is 3rd plural present active
  indicative, meaning to smear/ plaster (with)/ seal (wine jar).

  active indicative, meaning to fill.
- *servant* from *servo, servare, servavi, servatus* is 3rd plural present
  active indicative, meaning to watch over/protect.
- *Phrygia Ida* is Mount Ida in the ancient Troad region of western Anatolia
  (modern day Turkey).

      Nor in vain do those (bees) earnestly smear the thin vents in their house
      with wax, and fill the edges with dye and flowers, and they preserve glue,
      having been collected for this very duty, more clinging than both
      bird-lime and the tar of the Phrygian Ida.

| *saepe etiam effossis, si vera est fama, latebris*
| *sub terra fovere larem, penitusque repertae*
| *pumicibusque cavis exesaeque arboris antro.*

- *fovere* from *foveo, fovere, fovi, fotus* is 3rd plural perfect active
  indicative, meaning to maintain.
- *effossis latebris* is an ablative of absolute.
- Don't understand why *pumicibus cavis* and *exesae antro* are seemingly
  dative? 

      Likewise, if rumor is true, they often maintained a home with the lair
      having been dug out under the earth, and were discovered deep in both in
      a hollow pumice stone and a having been hollowed cave of a tree.

| *tu tamen et levi rimosa cubilia limo* 45
| *ungue fovens circum, et raras superinice frondes.*

- *ungue* from *unguo, unguere, unxi, unctus* is the present active imperative,
  meaning to anoint/rub.

  imperative, meaning to have/put forth leaves/be leafy.

      Nevertheless you, preserving them, both smear the cracked hives with
      smooth mud and scatter a few leaves on them.

| *neu propius tectis taxum sine, neve rubentis*
| *ure foco cancros, altae neu crede paludi,*
| *aut ubi odor caeni gravis aut ubi concava pulsu*
| *saxa sonant vocisque offensa resultat imago.* 50

- Long string of imperative, *sine, ure, crede*, i.e. to allow, burn, and trust.
- *odor* and *gravis* are connected via an implied *est* as predicate
  nominative.
- *pulsu* is the second supine denoting respect.

      Neither permit a yew near their dwelling, nor burn red crabs with the
      hearth, nor trust a deep marsh, or where the the scent of mud is heavy or
      where the hollow stones emit sounds when being struck and the having been
      struck voice's echo reverberates.

| *Quod superest, ubi pulsam hiemem Sol aureus egit*
| *sub terras caelumque aestiva luce reclusit,*
| *illae continuo saltus silvasque peragrant*
| *purpureosque metunt flores et flumina libant*
| *summa leves.* 55

- *superest* means to be left over, combining with adverbial *quod* meaning with
  respect to which.
- *leves* as delicately see notes.

      That which left over, when the golden sun has driven the having been
      beaten winter under the earth and has opened heaven with its summer light,
      immediately those (bees) scour the glades and forests and reap purple
      flowers and they delicately sip the top of rivers.

|              *hinc nescio qua dulcedine laetae*
| *progeniem nidosque fovent, hinc arte recentis*
| *excudunt ceras et mella tenacia fingunt.*

- *hinc* as from now on, see notes.
- *arte* literally with art, notes say skillfully.

      From now on, I do not know with what sweetness, they cherish the nest and
      family, from now on they skillfully fashion fresh wax and mould clinging
      honey.

| *hinc ubi iam emissum caveis ad sidera caeli*
| *nare per aestatem liquidam suspexeris agmen*
| *obscuramque trahi vento mirabere nubem,* 60
| *contemplator:*

- Why is *suspexeris* either perfect or future perfect? Doesn't seem to flow.
- *per aestatem liquidam* translated as through the clear summer air, see notes.
- *trahi* is the passive infinitive, but I don't like my translation.
- *contemplator* is watch carefully, see notes.

      From now on when you will look up to the swarm now having been expelled
      from the hollow toward the stars of the sky through the clear summer air
      and you will be amazed at the dark cloud to be drawn by the wind, watch
      carefully.

|               *aquas dulcis et frondes semper*
| *tecta perunt, huc tu iussos asperge sapores,*
| *trita melisphylla et cerinthae ignobile gramen,*
| *tinnitusque cie et Matris quate cymbala circum:*

      they are ever in quest of sweet waters and leafy coverts. Here scatter the
      scents I prescribe – bruised balm, and the honeywort’s lowly herb; raise
      a tinkling sound, and shake the Mighty Mother’s cymbals round about. 

| *ipsae consident medicatis sedibus, ipsae* 65
| *intima more suo sese in cunabula condent.*

      Of themselves they settle on the scented resting places; of themselves,
      after their wont, will hide far within their cradling cells.

| *Sin autem ad pugnam exierint nam saepe duobus*
| *regibus incessit magno discordia motu;*

      But, if haply for battle they have gone forth – for strife with terrible
      turmoil has often fallen on two kings; 

| *continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello*
| *corda licet longe praesciscere: namque morantis* 70
| *Martius ille aeris rauci canor increpat, et vox*
| *auditur fractos sonitus imitata tubarum;*

      and straightway you may presage from afar the fury of the crowd, and how
      their hearts thrill with war; for the warlike ring of the hoarse clarion
      stirs the loiterers, and a sound is heard that is like broken trumpet
      blasts.

| *tum trepidae inter se coeunt pennisque coruscant*
| *spiculaque exacuunt rostris aptantque lacertos*
| *et circa regem atque ipsa ad praetoria densae* 75
| *miscentur magnisque vocant clamoribus hostem;*

  to call.

      Then they nervously gather amongst themselves and quiver with their wings
      and sharpen their stings with their beaks and adjust their muscles and
      densly they are embroiled around the king and near the general's tent
      itself and they call the enemy with great cries.

| *ergo ubi ver nactae sudum camposque patentis,*
| *erumpunt portis;*

- *nactae* from *nanciscor, nancisci, nactus sum* is the perfect participle,
  meaning to obtain/get.
- *erumpunt* from *erumpo, erumpere, erupi, eruptus* is 3rd plural present
  active indicative, meaning to burst/sally forth/out.

      Therefore when they obtained a clear spring day and open plains, they burst
      forth from their gates;

|                  *concurritur, aethere in alto*
| *fit sonitus, magnum mixtae glomerantur in orbem*
| *praecipitesque cadunt;*

- *concurritur* from *concurro, concurrere, concucurri, concursus* is 3rd
  singular present passive indicative, meaning to run/assemble. Not sure how to
  translate this impersonal.
- *fit* from *fio, feri, factus sum* is 3rd singular present active indicative,
  and is the passive of facio.
- *mixtae* from *misceo, miscere, miscui, mixtus* is the perfect passive

  indicative, meaning to collect/assemble.
- *cadunt* from *cado, cadere, cecidi, casus* is 3rd plural present active
  indicative, meaning to fall/sink/die.

      there is a clash, in the high sky a loud sound is made, they, having been
      mingled, are amassed into a great sphere and they headlong plummet.

|                        *non densior aëre grando,* 80
| *nec de concussa tantum pluit ilice glandis:*
| *ipsi per medias acies insignibus alis*
| *ingentis animos angusto in pectore versant,*
| *usque adeo obnixi non cedere dum gravis aut hos*
| *aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga subegit.* 85
| *hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta*
| *pulveris exigui iactu compressa quiescent.*

      no thicker is hail from the sky, nor to such a extent does it rain of acorns
      from the shaken oak: In the midst of the battle-lines the chiefs themselves,
      with resplendent wings, turn over great souls in their small hearts, ever
      steadfast not to yield, until the heavy victor drives under either this or this
      to turn their backs in flight.  These movements of the spririts, these contests
      of such size, they will be kept quiet, having been compressed, by a toss of
      a little dust.

| *Verum ubi ductores acie revocaveris ambo,*
| *deterior qui visus, eum, ne prodigus obsit,*
| *dede neci; melior vacua sine regnet in aula.* 90
| *alter erit maculis auro squalentibus ardens;*
| *nam duo sunt genera: hic melior insignis et ore*
| *et rutilis clarus squamis; ille horridus alter*
| *desidia latamque trahens inglorius alvum.*

      But when you have called both captains from the battle-line, give to death he
      that seemed worse, lest the wasteful one is a nuisance, allow the better reign
      in the hall alone.  The one will be shining with rough spots of gold; for there
      are two kinds: this better one, noble of expression and bright with red scales; 

| *ut binae regum facies, ita corpora plebis.* 95

- *ut...ita* = as...so too. 
- Implies *est* in both comparisons.

      As the shapes of the kings are twofold, so too are the bodies of the
      subjects.

| *namque aliae turpes horrent, ceu pulvere ab alto*
| *cum venit et sicco terram spuit ore viator*
| *aridus; elucent aliae et fulgore coruscant*
| *ardentes auro et paribus lita corpora guttis.*

- *horrent* is 3rd plural present active indicative meaning to dread.
- *ceu...aridus* = *ceu cum aridus viator venit ab alto pulvere et spuit terram
  sicco ore*.
- *ardentes...guttis* = *corpora ardentes et lita paribus guttis auro*.

      For some ugly ones tremble, just as when the thirsty traveler came from the
      deep dust, and spat earth from his dried mouth. Others gleam, and flash
      with lightning, their bodies all ablaze and flecked with equal specks
      of gold. 

| *haec potior suboles, hinc caeli tempore certo* 100
| *dulcia mella premes, nec tantum dulcia quantum*
| *et liquida et durum Bacchi domitura saporem.*

- Implied *est* on *haec...suboles*.
- *certo* as appointed see notes.
- *tantum...quantum* is a coordinating conjunction meaning as much...as.
- Implied *sunt* on *domitura* turning it into the active periphrastic, which
  denotes a future or intended action.

      This is the better race, from these you will press sweet honeys during the
      appointed season of the sky, nor so much sweet as to both be clear and
      intended to subdue the harsh flavor of wine.

| *At cum incerta volant caeloque examina ludunt*
| *contemnuntque favos et frigida tecta relinquunt,*
| *instabilis animos ludo prohibebis inani.* 105

- Note *incerta* and *caelo* don't match in gender, and therefore cannot match
  in the ablative.
- *frigida* is in the proleptic use, see notes.
- Note that *prohibebis* is future and being used as a placeholder for
  imperative.

*At cum incerta examina volant (que) ludunt caelo (que) contemnunt favos et
relinquunt tecta frigida, prohibebis instabilis animos inani ludo.*

      But when the uncertain swarms fly and play in the sky and pay no heed to
      their honeycomb and abandon their houses to get cold, you will restrain
      their unsteady mind from inane play.

| *nec magnus prohibere labor: tu regibus alas*
| *eripe; non illis quisquam cunctantibus altum*
| *ire iter aut castris audebit vellere signa.*

- Jesus Vergil, chill with your bee abuse.
- Implied impersonal *est* connecting *magnus labor*.
- *iter* as aloft, see notes.

*nec [est] magnus labor prohibere: (tu) eripe alas regibus; non quisquam illis
cuntantibus [regibus] audebit ire iter aut vellere signa castris.*

      Nor is it a great labor to restrain them: snatch away the wings from the
      kings; No one from those hesitating kings will dare to go aloft or pluck
      the battle standard from the camps.

| *invitent croceis halantes floribus horti*
| *et custos furum atque avium cum falce saligna* 110
| *Hellespontiaci servet tutela Priapi.*

- Subjunctives here are hortatory.
- Genitive as against, see notes. Objective genitive.

*horti halantes croceis floribus invitent et custos furum atque avium, tutela
Hellespontiaci Priapi, servet cum falce saligna,*

      Let gardens being fragrant with golden flowers invite them and let the
      guard against thieves and birds, protector of Hellespontia Priapus,
      watch over them with his willow sickle.

| *ipse thymum pinosque ferens de montibus altis*
| *tecta serat late circum cui talia curae;*
| *ipse labore manum duro terat, ipse feracis*
| *figat humo plantas et amicos inriget imbris.* 115

- Note on *et...imbris* here makes no sense, *amicos* is accusative.

*cui curae talia, ipse, ferens thymum pinosque de monitbus altis, serat late
circum tecta; ipse teras manum duro labore, ipse figat feracis plantas humo et
inriget amicos imbris.*

      Let he to whom the concerns are such, himself, bringing thyme and pine
      from the high mountains, plant them around their homes; 
      let he himself wear out his hand with hard labor, himself fasten fruitful
      cuttings in the ground and let him water the friendly streams.

| *Atque equidem, extremo ni iam sub fine laborum*
| *vela traham et terris festinem advertere proram,*
| *forsitan et pinguis hortos quae cura colendi*
| *ornaret canerem, biferique rosaria Paesti,*
| *quoque modo potis gauderent intiba rivis* 120
| *et virides apio ripae, tortusque per herbam*
| *cresceret in ventrem cucumis;*
- *sub* the preposition, *fine* the noun fitting with *extremo*.
- Note *canderem* is imperfect. Why is this mixed like this? I don't know!
- Note makes no sense on *protis...rivis*. Drinking? *potis* is a p.p.p if
  anything.

*atque equidem, ni iam sub extremo fine laborum, traham vela et festinem
advertere proram terris, forsitan et canerem quae cura colendi ornaret pinguis
hortosm, biferique rosaria Paesti, quoque modo intiba gauderent potis rivis et
ripae virides apio, (que) [quoque modo] cucumis tortus per herbam cresceret in
ventrem;*

      and indeed, if I were not under the extreme edge of my labor, dragging my
      sails and hastening to turn the prow to land, perhaps I might also sing of
      what care of cultivating decorates rich gardens and of the twice-blooming
      roses of Paestum, and in what manner the endives are glad with the having
      been drunk streams and the banks green with celery, and in what manner the
      cucumber having been twisted through the grass grows into its belly.

|                               *nec sera comantem*
| *narcissum aut flexi tacuissem vimen acanthi*
| *pallentisque hederas et amantis litora myrtos.*

*nec tacuissem sera comantem narcissum aut vimen flexi acanthi pallentisque
hederas et litora-amantis myrtos.*

- The *amantis* turns the noun *litora* into a *adjective* describing the
  *Mrytles*.

      Nor would I have been silent about the late-flowering narcissus or the
      twig of the having been bent bear's foot and the pale ivy and the
      shore-loving Mrytles.

| *namque sub Oebaliae memini me turribus arcis,* 125
| *qua niger umectat flaventia culta Galaesus,*
| *Corycium vidisse senem, cui pauca relicti*
| *iugera ruris erant, nec fertilis illa iuvencis*
| *nec pecori opportuna seges nec commoda Baccho.*

- *memini* from *memini, meminisse* is 1st singular perfect active indicative,
  meaning to recall. Recall, perfect form present force.
- *Galaesus* is a river.
- The Corycian Cave is located on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, in central
  Greece. The Cilicians were famous gardeners.

*namque memini [Indirect speech] sub turribus Oebaliae arcis, qua niger Galaesus
umectat flaventia culta, me vidisse senem Corycium, [Dat. Possesor] cui erant
pauca jugera relicti ruris, nec illa fertilis iuvencis nec seges opportuna
pecori nec commoda Baccho.*

      For I recall that under the towers of a Spartan citadel, where the dark
      Galaesus waters the golden cultivated land, I saw an old Corycian man,
      who had a few jugerum of abandoned country, those (are) not fertile for
      young bulls nor opportune for the grain fields for cattle nor convinient
      for wine.

| *hic rarum tamen in dumis olus albaque circum* 130
| *lilia verbenasque premens vescumque papaver*
| *regum aequabat opes animis, seraque revertens*
| *nocte domum dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis.*

- This whole first 3 lines is an appositive fitting onto *regum...animis*.
- Treating *revertens* as imperfect, see notes.

*tamen hic, premens rarum olus albaque lilia verbenasque vescumque papaver
circum in dumis, aequabat opes regum animis, (que) revertens domum sera nocte
onerabat mensas inemptis dapibus.*

      Nevertheless that man, planting scattered vegetables and white lilies and
      vervains and thin poppies around in the thorns, was equaling the wealth of
      kings with spirit, and returning home at late night he was loading his
      table with an unbought feast.

| *primus vere rosam atque autumno carpere poma,*
| *et cum tristis hiems etiamnum frigore saxa* 135
| *rumperet et glacie cursus frenaret aquarum,*
| *ille comam mollis iam tondebat hyacinthi*
| *aestatem increpitans seram Zephyrosque morantis.*

- *carpere* as historical infinitive.
- Both *rumperet* and *frenaret* are imperfect subjunctives, fitting inside
  *cum* implying *cum* clause. Likely circumstancial. Could be concessive too.

*primus vere carpere rosam atque autumno [carpere] poma, et [Concessive cum] cum
tristis hiems etiamnum rumperet saxa frigore et frenaret cursus aquarum glacie,
ille iam tondebat comam mollis hyacinthi, increpitans seram aestatem (que)
morantis Zephyros.*

      First in the spring he was gathering a rose and in the fall he was
      gathering apples, and although sorrowful winter was even now breaking
      stones with it's cold and restraining the courses of the rivers with its
      ice, that man was already cutting the hair of the soft hyacinthus, chiding
      late summer and the delaying West-winds.

| *ergo apibus fetis idem atque examine multo*
| *primus abundare et spumantia cogere pressis* 140
| *mella favis; illi tiliae atque uberrima pinus,*
| *quotque in flore novo pomis se fertilis arbos*
| *induerat totidem autumno matura tenebat.*

- Not historical infinitive, implies *est* instead.
- *matura* must be short (implied by scansion).

*ergo idem (erat) primus abundare fetis apibus atque multo examine et cogere
spumantia mella pressis favis; [Dat. possesor] illi (sunt) tiliae atque uberrima
pinus, quotque fertilis arbos induerat pomis in novo flore totidem matura
(pomus) tenebat autumno.*

      Therefore the same man was the first to abound with bees honey-crammed and
      a large swarm and to collect the foaming honey from having been pressed
      honeycomb; He has lime and very fertile pine trees, and how many the
      fertile tree had been covered themselves with fruits in it's new blossom,
      so many ripe fruits it was holding in the autumn.

| *ille etiam seras in versum distulit ulmos*
| *eduramque pirum et spinos iam pruna ferentis* 145

      shadows for those drinking.

      However indeed I, myself having been hindered by unjust length, pass by these
      things and leave behind the recounting to others after me.

      Now come, let me make clear the qualities which Jupiter himself added to
      the bees, the reward for which they, having followed the melodius noises
      and rattling bronzes of the Curetes, fed the king of heaven under
      a Dictaen cave.

      having been obtained into the common stock.

      For some watch over foraging, and are exercising in the fields because of
      a fixed agreement; within the confines of their homes part of them put
      a tear of a nacissus and the clinging glue of bark, the first foundation
      for the honeycombs, then they hang up clinging wax; others lead out the
      grown up offspring, the hope of the clan; others crowd the most pure
      honey and stretch the cells by means of clear nectar. 

| *sunt quibus ad portas cecidit custodia sorti,* 165
| *inque vicem speculantur aquas et nubila caeli,*
| *aut onera accipiunt venientum, aut agmine facto*
| *ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.*

      There are some to whom the care for gates fell by lots, and in turn they
      watch the waters and clounds of heaven, or accept the burdens of those
      cominga, or they drive with a having been made troop the drones, a lazy
      herd, from the stalls

| *fervet opus, redolentque thymo fragrantia mella.*

      The work burns, and the fragrant honey is odorous with thyme.

      But when the Cyclops hastly forge lightning from tough material, 

as, when the Cyclopes in haste forge bolts from tough ore, some with oxhide
bellows make the blasts come and go, others dip the hissing brass in the lake,
while Aetna groans under the anvils laid upon her;

- GOT UP TO 175


|                     *grandaevis oppida curae*

The aged have charge o the towns, the building of the hives, the fashioning of

- TODO

| *saepe etiam duris errando in cotibus alas*
| *attrivere, ultroque animam sub fasce dedere:*
| *tantus amor florum et generandi gloria mellis.* 205

- *errando* from *erro, errare, erravi, erratus* is the gernund, meaning to
  wander. Per Huxley, 'rare use of instrumental ablative almost in the sense of
  participle *errantes*'.
- *attrivere* from *attero, atterere, attrivi, attritus* is 3rd plural perfect
  active indicative, meaning to run/rub against. Note the alternate form.
- *dedere* from *do, dare, dedi, datus* is 3rd plural perfect active indicative,
  meaning to give.
- Huxley calls *attrivere* and *dedere* gnomic. 'In English grammar, the gnomic
  present is a verb in the present tense used to express a general truth without
  reference to time.'
- *generandi* from *genero, generare* is the gerund(ive), meaning to beget.
- Implies *est* coupling *tantus* and *amor*.

      Furthermore they often wore down their wings by wandering in the hard
      rocks, and voluntarily give their lives under the burden: so great is

| *ergo ipsas quamvis angusti terminus aevi*
| *excipiat (neque enim plus septima ducitur aestas),*
| *at genus immortale manet, multosque per annos*
| *stat fortuna domus, et avi numerantur avorum.*

- *excipiat* from *excipio, excipere, excepi, exceptus* is 3rd singular present
  active subjunctive, meaning to take out/remove. Per Huxley, translate as
  awaits.
- Implicit *quam* after *plus* per Huxley.
- *immortale* is predicative, so I turned it into an accusative adjective.
- Using the fourth declension *domus*.

      Therefore, although the boundary of a narrow generation snatches them
      themselves (for more than the seventh summer is not lead), but the race abides
      eternally, and through many years the fortune of the house stands, and the
      grandfather's grandfather are counted.

| *praeterea regem non sic Aegyptus et ingens* 210
| *Lydia nec populi Parthorum aut Medus Hydaspes*
| *observant.*

- Added a *neque* because it's lack of being there stifled me.
- *observant* from *observo, observare* is 3rd plural present active indicative,
  meaning to watch.

      the Medes Hydaspes heed their king in such a way.

|            *rege incolumi mens omnibus una est;*
| *amisso rupere fidem, constructaque mella*
| *diripuere ipsae et cratis solvere favorum.*

- *amisso* is ablative absolute, with an implicit *rege*.
- *rupere* meaning to break, *diripuere* meaning to tear apart, and *solvere*
  meaning to release are all instantaneous perfects via Huxley.
- The back of the book has wicker-work for *cratis* but lewis and short has
  lattice, and I think that's better.

      They are of one mind with a safe king; with the king having been lost,
      they break their loyalty, and they themselves tear asunder the having been
      constructed honey and they unwind the lattices of the honeycombs.

| *ille operum custos, illum admirantur et omnes* 215
| *circumstant fremitu denso stipantque frequentes,*
| *et saepe attollunt umeris et corpora bello*
| *obiectant pulchramque petunt per vulnera mortem.*

- implies *est* on *ille...custos*.

  indicative, meaning to admire.

  indicative, meaning to stand around.

- *pulcher* as glorius.

      He is the guard of their works, to that king they admire and all stand
      around him with a dense roar and they frequently crowd him, and often they
      raise him with their shoulders and expose their bodies during war and
      seek glorius death through wounds.

| *His quidam signis atque haec exempla secuti*
| *esse apibus partem divinae mentis et haustus* 220
| *aetherios dixere; deum namque ire per omnis*
| *terrasque tractusque maris caelumque profundum;*
| *hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,*
| *quemque sibi tenuis nascentem arcessere vitas:*

- Why does *quidam* fit on the subject of *dixere* if *dixere* is plural.
- *secuti* from *sequor, seci, secutus sum* is the perfect passive participle,
  meaning to follow.
- *dixere* from *dico, dicere, dixi, dictus* is 3rd plural perfect active
  indicative, meaning to say. This is a head verb opening up indirect speech
  with *esse*.
- *tractus* as extents per Huxley.
- One huge ass indirect speech, *arcessere* and *ire* also fall underneath it.

      With these signs certain people, having followed these signs, said that bees
      have part of the heavenly mind and ethereal droughts; for they say that
      it's divine to walk through all things, lands, extents of the sea, and the
      profound heaven; From here sheeps, herds of cattle, men, each kind of
      animals, each thing being born summons fragile life for themselves.

| *scilicet huc reddi deinde ac resoluta referri* 225
| *omnia, nec morti esse locum, sed viva volare*
| *sideris in numerum atque alto succedere caelo.*

- *reddi* from *reddo, reddere, reddidi, redditus* is the present passive
  infinitive, meaning to return.
- *referri* from *refero, referre, rettuli, relatus* is the present passive
  infinitive, meaning to bring/carry back.
- *volare* from *volo, volare* is the present active infinitive, meaning to fly.
- *succedere* from *succedo, succedere, successi, successus* is the present
  active infinitive, meaning to climb/advance.
- Reduplicated *in* for the *alto caelo* not sure if it makes sense.

      Of course all things are returned and then, having been dispersed,
      are brought back here, nor is there a place for death, but the living
      things fly into the rank of a star and climb in the high heaven.

| *Si quando sedem augustam servataque mella*
| *thesauri relines, prius haustu sparsus aquarum*
| *ora fove, fumosque manu praetende sequacis.* 230

- *Si quando* is a construction meaning 'if ever'.
- *relines* from *relino, relinere, relinevi, relinitus* is 2nd singular future
  active indicative, meaning to unseal.
- *fove* from *foveo, fovere, fovi, fotus* is the present active imperative,
  meaning to cherish (dictionary specifically points out this line).

      If you ever will unseal the sacred home and the protected honey of their
      treasure, before, having been sprinkled with a draught of waters, cherish
      your mouth, and stretch out pursuing smoke with your hand.

| *bis gravidos cogunt fetus, duo tempora messis:*

- *bini, bis* is an adverb answering 'how often', and *duo duae* is a cardinal
  answering 'how many'.
- *cogunt* from *cogo, cogere, coegi, coactus* is 3rd plural present active
  indicative, meaninig to gather.

      twofold they gather the teeming offspring, there are two times of harvest:

| *Taygete simul os terris ostendit honestum*
| *Pleas et Oceani spretos pede reppulit amnis,*
| *aut eadem sidus fugiens ubi Piscis aquosi*
| *tristior hibernas caelo descendit in undas.* 235

- *simul* as *simulatque*.
- *ostendit* from *ostendo, ostdendere, ostendi, ostensus* is 3rd singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to show.
- Not certain about *Pleas*. Seems to be fitting with *Taygete*, but the ending
  is wrong.
- *reppulit* from *repello, repellere, reppuli, repelsus* is 3rd singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to repel.
- *eadem* adverb meaning at the same time. Coordinating nicely with *simul

  participle, meaning to fly.
- *descendit* from *descendo, descendere, descendi, descensus* is 3rd singular

      The moment that Taygete, the Pleiades, showed her distinguished face to the
      earth and with a foot repelled the having been scorned rivers of the ocean,
      or when the same sadder woman, the flying constellation of the watery
      fish, descends from heaven into the wintry wave.

| *illis ira modum supra est, laesaeque venenum*
| *morsibus inspirant, et spicula caeca relinquunt*
| *adfixae venis, animasque in vulnere ponunt.*

- *illis* as dative of possesor.
- *inspirant* from *inspiro, inspirare, inspiravi, inspiratus* is 3rd plural
  present active indicative, meaning to breath into. Takes an ablative, this
  case *morsibus*.
- *relinquunt* from *relinquo, relinquere, relinqui, reictus* is 3rd plural
  present active indicative, meaning to leave behind.
- *advixae* from *adfigo, adfigere, adfixi, adfixus* is the perfect passive
  participle, meaning to fasten. This takes a dative in the form of *venis*.

      These bees have anger beyond the limit, and they, having been offended,
      breath poison into their stings, and, having been fastened to veins, they
      leave behind their unseen stings, and place their lives in the wound.

| *sin duram metues hiemem parcesque futuro*
| *contunsosque animos et res miserabere fractas,* 240
| *at suffire thymo cerasque recidere inanis*
| *quis dubitet?*

But if you fear a harsh winter, and would be lenient with their future, and
have pity for their utterly crushed spirits and broken fortunes – but who would
hesitate to fumigate them with thyme, and cut away the empty waxen cells?

|               *nam saepe favos ignotus adedit*
| *stellio et lucifugis congesta cubilia blattis*

| *aut asper crabro imparibus se immiscuit armis,* 245
| *aut dirum tiniae genus, aut invisa Minervae*
| *laxos in foribus suspendit aranea cassis.*

For often the newt, unnoticed, has nibbled at the combs, the light-shunning
beetles cram the chambers, and the unhelpful drone seats him at another’s board.
Or the fierce hornet has mixed in their unequal armies, or the moths appear,
a pestilent race, or the spider, hateful of Minerva, hangs in the doorway her
loose-woven nets.

| *quo magis exhaustae fuerint hoc acrius omnes*
| *incumbent generis lapsi sarcire ruinas*
| *complebuntque foros et floribus horrea texent.* 250

By how much more their hoardes are drained, by this more harshly they will press
on to redeem the ruin of their perished kind, and they will fill their cells and
they will weave their barns with flowers.

| *Si vero, quoniam casus apibus quoque nostros*
| *vita tulit, tristi languebunt corpora morbo -*
| *quod iam non dubiis poteris cognoscere signis:*

But, since life brought our calamities aslo to bees, if their bodies languish
with sorrowful disease – which you will be able to recognize with not doubtful
