# The Devil and a Thirteenth Century Schoolboy

1. *In illā ecclēsiā erat scholāris parvus.*

    In that church was a little scholar.

2. *Cum hic diē quādam versūs compōnere ex eā māteriā ā magistrō datā nōn posset
   et trīstis sedēret, diabolus in fōrmā hominis vēnit.*

- Subordinate is cum clause with subjunctive verb (sedēret: 3rd singular
  imperfect active subjunctive, posset: same parse).

    When on a certain day this boy was not able to compose versus out of that
    material given by the teacher and was sadly sitting, the devil came in the
    shape of a human.

3. *Cum dīxisset: "Quid est, puer? Cūr sīc trīstis sedēs?" respondit puer:
   "Magistrum muem timeō quod versūs compōnere nōn possum dē themate quod ab eō
   recēpī."*

- *Cum dīxisset: [...] respondit puer*. Causal cum clause, dixisset: 3rd
  singular pluperfect active subjunctive, respondit: 3rd singular perfect active
  indicative.
- *Cūr sīc trīstis sedēs?* Here *trīstis* is nominative modifying the you
  implicitly present in *sedēs*.
- First *quod* is a conjunction meaning because, second is a relative pronoun.
  *timeō* and *possum* in 1st singular present active indicative, and recēpī in
  same but perfect.

    When he asked: "What is it, boy? Why do you sadly sit in this way?" the boy
    answered: "I fear my teacher because I am not able to compose the versus
    concerning the theme that I recieved from him."

4. *Et ille: "Vīsne mihi servīre sī ego versūs tibi compōnam?"*

- *Vīs* = be willing 2nd singular future active indicative.
- *mihi* in dative because *servīre* takes dative.
- This is a future-more-vivid conditional since *compōnam* is in the 1st person
  future active indicative tense and so is *vīs*. which sets off a (should, would)
  construction.

    And he said that: "Do you wish to serve me if I compose your versus?"

5. *Puer, nōn intellegēns quod ille esset diabolus, respondit:*

- *intellgēns* is a present participle.
- *esset* is second singular imperfect active subjunctive, and the quod before
  would indicate to me the start of a characteristic clause.

    The boy, not understanding that the man is of the sort of the devil,
    responded:

6. *"Etiam, domine, parātus sum facere quidquid iusseris -- dummodo versūs habeam
   et verbera vītem."*

- *parātus* perfect passive participle "prepared".
- *iusseris* 2nd singular futperf present active indicative
- *dummodo* takes the subjunctive, which is what *habeam* and *vītem* are in.

    "Indeed, O lord, I am prepared to do whatever you will have ordered --
    provided that I have the verses and I avoid lashes.

7. *Tum, versibus statim dictātīs, diabolus abiit.*

- *versibus statim dictātis* is an ablative absolute, with *dictātīs* being in
  the perfect passive.

    Then, with the versus having immediately been dictated, the devil departed.

8. *Cum puer autem hōs versūs magistrō suō dedisset, hic, excellentiam versuum
   mīrātus, timuit, dūcēns scientiam in illīs dīvīnam, nōn hūmānam.*

- Causal Cum clause pairing with *dedisset* which is 3rd pluperfect present
  active subjunctive.
- *magistrō suō* is dative of reference.

    However when the boy had given these verses to his teacher, this teacher,
    marveling at the excellence of the versus, feared it, regarding the
    knowledge in those divine things as not human.

9. *Et ait: "Dīc mihi, quis tibi hōs versūs dictāvit?"*

    And he said: "Tell me, who dictated these versus for you?"

10. *Prīmum puer respondit: "Ego, magister!"*

    First, the boy responded: "I, teacher!"

11. *Magistrō autem nōn crēdente et verbum interrogātionis saepius repetente,
    puer omnia tandem cōnfessus est.*

- *Magistrō autem nōn crēdente* is an ablative absolute, with *crēdente* and
  *repetente* being a present participle.
- *cōnfessus est* is 3rd singular perfect passive indicative, but I couldn't
  find a nice way to translate that.

    However with the teacher not believing and more often repeating words of
    interrogation, the boy at last confessed everything.

12. *Tum magister "Fīlī", inquit, "ille versificātor fuit diabolus. Cārissime,
    semper illum sēductōrem et eius opera cavē."*

- *Cārissime* is vocative and a superlative.

    Then the teacher said "Son, that versifier was the devil. O most beloved, 
    always beware that seducer and his works.

13. *Et puer diabolum eiusque opera relīquit.*

    And the boy abandoned the devil and the works of his.

# Cladius' Excremental Expiration

1. *Et ille quidem animam ēbulliit, et ex eō dēsiit vīvere vidērī.*

- *ēbulliit = ēbullivit* which is 3rd singular perfect active indicative.
- I found a dictionary entry which said *animam ēbulliit* went to expired.
- Struggled a bit with the second half and how to treat infinitives there.
  I wanted to go indirect speech, but it wasn't fitting.

    And that man indeed bubbled out his spirit, and from that he stopped to seem
    to live.

2. *Exspīrāvit autem dum comoedōs audit, ut sciās mē nōn sine causā illōs
   timēre.*

- I know translating *audit* as listening is in the wrong tense.
- *Exspīrāvit* is historical perfect which implies that this result clause is
  not following sequence of tenses.

    However he died as he listened to comedians, so you know I do not fear
    those men without reason.

3. *Ultima vōx eius haec inter hominēs audīta est, cum maiōrem sonitum ēmisisset
   illā parte quā facilius loquēbātur:*

- *audīta est* 3rd singular perfect passive indicative.
- *Ultima, vōx, haec* all pairs together.
- The *cum* clause pairs with *ēmisisset* which is 3rd singular pluperfect
  active subjunctive.
- Those last ablatives are of instrument or means.
- *facilius* is the comparative adverb.

    This loudest expression of his was heard among the men, because he had
    let out a vast noise by that part with which he easily spoke.

4. *"Vae mē, putō, concacāvī."*

    "Alas, I think I've shit myself."

5. *Quod an fēcerit, nesciō -- omnia certē concacāvit!*

- *fēcerit* is 3rd singular perfect active subjunctive, this is introducing an
  indirect question.
- I read that *an* can introduce a question containing the notion of surprise or
  indignation.

    Whether he really did it, I do not know -- he surely soiled everything!

# Sorry, Nobody's Home

1. *Nāsīca ad poētam Ennium vēnit.*

    Nasica came to the poet Ennium.

2. *Cum ad iānuam Ennium quaesīvisset et serva respondisset eum in casā nōn
   esse, sēnsit illam dominī iussū id dīxisse et Ennium vērō esse in casā.*

- *quaesīvisset* is 3rd singular pluperfect active subjunctive of *quaero,
  quaerere, quaesivi, quaesitus*.
- *respondisset* is 3rd singular pluperfect active subjunctive of *respondeo,
  respondere, respondi, responsus*.
- *quasīvisset* and *respondisset* are subjunctive because they're inside of
  a circumstancial *cum* clause, and there's an indirect statement too.
- *sēnsit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *sentio, sentire, sensi,
  sensus*.
- *dīxisse* is the perfect active infinitive of *dico, dicere, dixi, dictus*.
- This second part of the sentence also has indirect statement set off by
  *dīxisse* and *esse*.
- *iussū* is in the ablative with the usage of respect.

    When he had sought Ennium at his door and the slave had responded that he
    was not in the house, he felt that she had said that by the order of the
    master and that in truth Ennium was in the house.

3. *Post paucōs diēs, cum Ennius ad Nāsīcam vēnisset et eum ad iānuam quaereret,
   Nāsīca ipse exclāmāvit sē in casā nōn esse.*

- *vēnisset* is 3rd singular pluperfect active subjunctive of *venio, venire,
  veni, ventus*.
- *quaereret* is 3rd singular imperfect active subjunctive of *quaero, quaerere,
  quaesivi, quaesitus*.
- These are both in subjunctive because they form a circumstancial *cum* clause.
- *exclāmāvit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *exclamo, exlamare,
  exlamavi, exlamatus*.
- *esse* coupled with *exclāmāvit* is indirect speech.

    After a few days, when Ennius had came to Nasica and was seeking him at the
    door, Nasica himself exclaimed that he was not in the house.

4. *Tum Ennius "Quid?" inquit, "Ego nōn cognōscō vōcem tuam?"*

- *cognōscō* is 1st singular present active indicative of *cognosco, cognoscere,
  cognovi, cognitus*.

    Then Ennius said: "What? Am I not acquainted with the voice of yours?

5. *Hīc Nāsīca merō cum sale respondit:*

- What the heck is *hīc* supposed to do in this session.

    At this point Nasica responded with pure wit:

6. *"Vae, homō es impudēns!*

    Alas, you are a shameless person!

7. *Ego, cum tē quaererem, servae tuae crēdidī tē nōn in casā esse;*

- *quaererem* is 1st singular imperfect active subjunctive from *quaero,
  quaerere, quaesivi, quaesitus*, and it's subjunctive because it's in
  a circumstancial *cum*.
- *crēdidī* is 1st singular perfect active indicative of *credo, credere,
  credidi, creditus*. Note it takes dative which is why *servae tuae* is in the
  dative.
- Is my translation of "were" correct? I know this is a sequence of tenses
  issue, but I'm not sure.

    When I was seeking you, I believed your servant that you were not in the
    house;

8. *nōnne tū mihi ipsī nunc crēdis?"*

    Now you do not believe me myself?

# Maecenas Passage

1. *Nūlla fors mihi tē, Maecēnās, obtulit: optimus Vergilius et post hunc Varius
   dīxērunt quid essem.*

- *obtulit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *offero, offere,
    obtuli, oblatus*. This frequently takes the dative, which is why I changed
    it from offered to volunteered (Traupman).
- *dīxērunt* is 3rd plural perfect active indicative of *dico, dicere, dixi,
    dictus*.
- *essem* is 1st singular imperfect active subjunctive of *sum, esse, fuī,
    futurus*.

    No fortune volunteered you for me, Maecenas: Vergil, the greatest, and after
    this man Varius, had said what I am.

2. *Ut ad tē vēnī, singultim pauca locūtus (nam pudor prohibēbat plūra profārī),
   ego nōn dīxī mē clārō patre nātum esse sed nārrāvī quod eram.*

- *vēnī* is 1st singular perfect active indicative of *venio, venire, veni,
    ventus*.
- *locūtus* is the perfect participle of *loquor, loqui, locutus sum*, but since
    it's a deponent instead of *having been* we translate as *having*.
- *prohibēbat is 3rd singular imperfect active indicative of *prohibeo,
    prohibere, prohibui, prohibitus*.
- *dīxī* is 1st singular perfect active indicative and *nātum esse* is the
    perfect passive infinitive of *nascor, nasci, natus sum*, which is deponent)

    As I came to you, having one by one said little (for decency was
    preventing [me] to say much), I had not said that I had been born from
    a famous father but I told you what I was.

3. *Respondēs, ut tuus mōs est, pauca.*

- *ut* here is just a conjunction, and *tuus mōs* is in the nominative because
    *est* is functioning as an equal sign.

    You respond little, as it is your cutlure.

4. *Abeō et post nōnum mēnsem mē revocās iubēsque esse in amīcōrum numerō.*

- *abeo* from *abeo, abire, abivi, abitus* is 1st singular present active
    indicative, meaning to depart.
- *revocas* from *revoco, revocare, revocavi, revocatus* and *iubes* from
    *iubeo, iubere, iussi, iussus* are both 2nd singular present active
    indicative, meaining to call back and to order respectively.

    I depart and after the ninth month you recall me and order me to be in the
    number of friends.

5. *Hoc magnum esse dūcō, quod placuī tibi, quī bonōs ā turpibus sēcernis nōn
   patre clārō sed vītā et pectore pūrō.*

- *placui* from *placeo, placere, placui, placitus* is obviously the third
    principle part, meaning to please.
- *secernis* from *secerno, secernere, secrevi, secretus* is 2nd singular
    present active indicative, meaning to seperate.

   I consider this to be great, the fact that I pleased you, you who seperate
   the good from the ugly not because of a famous father but because of clear
   heart and life.

6. *Atquī sī mea nātūra est mendōsa vitiīs mediocribus ac paucīs sed aliōquī
   rēcta, sī neque avāritiam neque sordēs quisquam mihi obiciet, sī pūrus sum et
   īnsōns (ut mē laudem!) et vīvō cārus amīcīs, cause fuit pater meus.*

7. *Hic enim, cum pauper in parvō agrō esset, tamen nōluit mē puerum in lūdum
   Flāviī mittere sed ausu est mē Rōmam ferre ad artēs discendās quās senātōrēs
   suōs filiōs docent.*

8. *Ipse mihi paedagōgus incorruptissimus eta.*

9. *Mē līberum servāvit nōn sōlum ab omnī factō sed etiam ab turpī opprobriō.*

10. *Quārē laus illī ā mē dēbētur et grātia magna.*

# Hannibal Passage

1. *Hāc igitur aetāte Hannibal cum patre in Hispāniam profectus est.*

- *Hāc aetāte* is an ablative of time when.
- *profectus est* is 3rd singular perfect passive indicative and has parts
  proficiscor, proficisci, profectus sum. Since it's deponent it translates as
  active.
- *cum patre* ablative of accompaniment.

    Therefore during this age Hannibal departed with his father into Spain.

2. *Post multōs annōs, Hamilcare et Hasdrubale interfectīs, exercitus eī
   imperium trādidit.*

- *Hamilcare* is masculine ablative, father of Hannibal. *Hasdrubale* ablative
  masculine of Hasdrubal Barca. *Interfectīs* is the perfect passive participle
  of *interficio, interficere, interfeci, interfectus* and is in the ablative,
  setting up an ablative absolute.
- *trādidit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative from *trado, tradere,
  tradidi, traditus*. *trado* takes dative, which in this case is *eī*.

    After many years, with Hamilcar and Hasdrubal having been killed, the army
    handed over command to him.

3. *Sīc Hannibal, quīnque et vīgintī annōs nātus, imperātor factus est.*

- Accusative of extent of time is *annōs nātus*. Ablative is specific,
  Accusivitve describes a length of time.
- *factus est* is 3rd singular perfect passive indicative of *facio, facere,
  feci, factus*. Note *factus sum* is a compulative verb and thus takes
  nominative on both sides and acts like an equal sign.

    So Hannibal, having been born for 20 and 5 years, was made commander.

4. *Tribus annīs omnēs gentēs Hispāniae superāvit et trēs exercitūs maximōs
   parāvit.*

- *superāvit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative, same with *paravīt*.
- *Tribus annīs* is ablative of time within which.
- *maxiōs* is superlative roughly meaning greatest, but that wasn't dropping in
  nicely so I used a synonym peerless.

    Within three years he overcame all people of Spain and prepared three
    peerless armies.

5. *Ex hīs ūnum in Āfricam mīsit, alterum cum frātre in Hispāniā relīquit,
   tertium in Italiam sēcum dūxit.*

- *mīsit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *mitto, mittere, misi,
  missus* to send.
- *relīquit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *relinquo, relinquere,
  reliqui, relictus*.
- *dūxit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *duco, ducere, duxi,
  ductus*.
- *sēcum* is *sē + cum* and roughly means with himself.

    Out of these he sent the first into Africa, he left behind one with his 
    brother in Spain, he led the third into Italy with himself.

6. *Ad Alpēs vēnit, quās nēmō umquam ante eum cum exercitū trānsierat.*

- *vēnit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *venio, venire, veni,
  ventus* (it's perfect because of the ē).
- *trānsierat* is 3rd singular pluperfect active indicative of *transeo,
  transire, transivi, transitus*.

    He came through the Apls, which before him no one ever had crossed with an
    army.

7. *Alpicōs cōnantēs prohibēre eum trānsitū occīdit; loca patefēcit; itinera
   mūnīvit; effēcit ut elephantus īre posset quā anteā ūnus homō vix poterat
   rēpere.*

- *prohibēre* is an infinitive of *prohibero, prohibere, prohibui, prohibitus*.
- *cōnantēs* is present participle of *conor, conari, conatus sum*.
- *occīdit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicitve of *occido, occidere,
  occidi, occisus*.
- *patefēcit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *patefacio,
  patefacere, patefeci, patefactus*.
- *mūnīvit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *munio, munire, munivi,
  munitus*.
- *effēcit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *efficio, efficere,
  effeci, effectus*. With *ut* you can translate it as "brought it about that".
- *ire* is the infinitive of *eo, ire, ivi, itus*.
- *posset* is 3rd singular imperfect active subjunctive of *possum, posse,
  potui*. This is setting off the substantive clause of result, which occurs
  with verbs of effort or accomplishment. This sits midway between result and
  purpose, which is why it is distinct.

    He killed the Alpine men attempting to hinder him from passage; revealed
    the territory; fortified the roads; brought it about that an elephant would
    be able to walk where before a single man was hardly able to crawl.

8. *Sīc in Italiam pervēnit et, Scīpiōne superātō, Etrūriam petīvit.*

- *pervēnit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *pervenio, pervenire,
  perveni, perventus*. Translated as arrived with an *in + Acc.*
- *superātō* is perfect passive participle in the ablative, which combined with
  *Scīpiōne* which is also ablative gives us an ablative absolute construction.
- *petīvit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *peto, petere, petivi,
  petitus*.

    Thus he arrived at Italy and, with Scipio having been defeated, attacked
    Etruria.

9. *Hōc in itinere tam gravī morbō oculōrum adfectus est ut posteā numquam
   dextrō oculō bene ūterētur.*

- *adfectus est* is 3rd singular perfect passive indicative of *adficio,
  adficere, adfeci, adfectus*.
- *ūterētur* is 3rd singular imperfect passive subjunctive of *utor, uti, usus
  sum *. This is subjunctive because it's in a result clause, and note by
  sequence of tenses we ignore the imperfect. Furthermore, this very takes the
  ablative and that's why *dextrō oculō* is ablative.

    On this journey Hannibal was afflicted by so grave an illness of the eye
    that afterwards he never used his right eye well.

10. *Multōs ducēs exercitūsque Rōmānōs superāvit; longum est omnia proelia
    ēnumerāre.*

- *superāvit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *supero, superare,
  superavi, superatus*.
- *longum est (w/ infinitive)* has the translation "It would take too long to --"
- *ēnumerāre* is the present active infinitive of *enumero, enumerare,
  enumeravi, enumeratus*.

    He overcame many Roman generals and armies; it would take too long to count
    all the battles.

11. *Post Cannēnsem autem pugnam nēmō eī in aciē in Italiā restitit.*

- *restitit* is 3rd singular perfect active indicative of *resisto, resistere,
  restiti, --*. Note this takes the dative, which is why *eī* is in the dative.
- *Cannēnsem* is an accusitive adjective, but it's a city name too, so it's
  confusing.

    However after the Cannae battle no one in the battle line withstood him in
    Italy.

12. *Cum autem P. Scīpiō tandem in Āfricam invāsisset, Hannibal, ad patriam
    dēfendendam revocātus, Zamae victus est.*

- *invāsisset* is 3rd singular pluperfect active subjunctive of *invado,
  invadere, invasi, invasus*. It's subjunctive because it's in a cum clause.
  With an *in + Acc.* this is translated as "attacked + Acc.".
- *defendendam* is the accusative singular feminine future passive participle of
  *defendo, defendere, defendi, defensus*, i.e. the gerundive and it pairs with
  *ad*.
- *recovātus* is the nominative singular masculine perfect passive participle of
  *revoco, revocare, revocavi, revocatus*.
- *victus est* is 3rd singular perfect passive indicative of *vinco, vincere,
  vici, victus*.
- *Zamae* is locative.

    However, when P. Scipio finally attacked Africa, Hannibal, having been
    recalled for the purpose of defending his country, was defeated at Zama.

13. *Sīc post tot annōs Rōmānī sē perīculō Pūnicō līberāvērunt.*

- *līberāvērunt* is 3rd plural perfect active indicative of *libero, liberare,
  liberavi, liberatus*.
- *perīculō Pūnicō* is an ablative of seperation.

    Thus after so many years the Romans freed themselves from the Punic danger.
