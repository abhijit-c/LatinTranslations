Naso Tomitanae iam non novus incola terrae
  hoc tibi de Getico litore mittit opus.
```

- *Tomitanae...terrae* in apposition to *Naso*.
- Naso, now not a new inhabitant of the country of Tomis, sends this work to you
  from the Getic shore.

```
si vacat, hospitio peregrinos, Brute, libellos
  excipe, dumque aliquo, quolibet abde loco.
```

- *vacat* from *vaco, vacare* is 3rd singular present active indicative, meaning
  to be empty/vacant. 
- *dumque...loco* is a brachylogical expression for *et dum aliquo loco libellos
  abdas, quolibet abde loco*.
- If he is idle, extract, Brutus, the foreign books with hospitality, and while
  you may put away the books in some place, put them away in whatever place.

```
publica non audent intra monimenta venire, 5
  ne suus hoc illis clauserit auctor iter.
```

- *clauserit* from *claudo, claudere, clausi, clausus* is 3rd singular perfect
  active subjunctive, meaning to close. This is within a *ne* clause, therefore
  *fear* clause? *non audent* isn't really fear, it could be negative purpose
  clause?
- They do not dare to enter within public monuments, lest their own author close
  this road for them.

```
a, quotiens dixi: 'certe nil turpe docetis,
  ite. patet castis versibus ille locus.'
```

- *quotiens* weird adverb meaning 'how many times' in either interrogative or
  exclamatory sense.
- Ah, How many times did I say: 'You all certainly teach nothing ugly, go. That
  place is open to pure verses.

```
non tamen accedunt, sed, ut aspicis ipse, latere
  sub lare privato tutius esse putant. 10
```

- *putant* opens up indirect speech, taking *esse* not *latere*. In turn,
  *latere* feeds *esse*.
- They nevertheless do not approach, but, as you yourself see, they think that
  it is safer to lurk under a private home.

```
quaeris, ubi hos possis nullo componere laeso?
  qua steterant Artes, pars vacat illa tibi.
```

- *nullo* for *nemine*, poetic usage.
- Why is *possis* subjunctive? *ubi* takes the indicative.
- Not sure how to translate *qua*. I tried the adverbial usage. I want it to be
  relative describing *pars*, but it doesn't seem to be fitting in case/gender.
- You seek, where you may be able to compose these with no one having been
  offended? Where the Ars Amatoria had stood, that part is empty for you.

```
quid veniat, novitate roges fortasse sub ipsa.
  accipe quodcumque est, dummodo non sit amor.
```

- *veniat* is impersonal question, and then *roges* is subjunctive because it's
  subordinate to it.
- *roges* is potential subjunctive, and then *veniat* is subjunctive because
  indirect question.
- *est* is impersonal.
- *dummodo* takes the subjunctive (*sit*).
- what is coming, you perhaps could ask under the newness itself. Take
  whatever is it, provided it is not love.

```
invenies, quamvis non est miserabilis index, 15
  non minus hoc illo triste, quod ante dedi.
```

- *illo* as ablative of comparison.
- You will discover, although it is not a miserable sign, that this is not less
  sad than that, because I gave it earlier.

```
rebus idem, titulo differt, et epistula cui sit
  non occultato nomine missa docet.
```

- *missa sit* is 3rd singular perfect passive subjunctive, meaning to send.
- Why is this subjunctive. No fucking clue! Suppressed indefinite => relative
  clause of characteristic?
- the same with respect to things, it differs with respect to title, and the
  letter teaches to whom it is sent with the name not having been concealed.

```
nec vos hoc vultis, sed nec prohibere potestis,
  Musaque ad invitos officiosa venit. 20
```

- You all do not wish this, but you all are not able to prohibit it, and the
  dutiful Muse comes to those reluctant.

```
quidquid id est, adiunge meis: nihil impedit ortos
  exule servatis legibus Urbe frui.
```

- Such as it is, add it to my works: With the laws maintained nothing impedes that the children enjoy the
  city of exile from enjoying the city.

```
quod metuas non est: Antoni scripta leguntur,
  doctus et in promptu scrinia Brutus habet—
nec me nominibus furiosus confero tantis: 25
  saeva deos contra non tamen arma tuli.
```

- There is nothing which you fear, the writings of Antony, and educated
  Brutus has a shelf at the ready - neither do I compare myself to such names,
  I nevertheless did not bring such savage arms against the gods.

fert liber Aeneaden, et non iter omne patebit? 35
  at patriae pater hic, ipsius ille fuit.

  latter was the father of the countryside, the former was the father of he
  himself.

  iactantem Pharia tinnula sistra manu?

  not for me, but that is demanded for the great god.'

```
nec, quia vel merui vel sensi principis iram,
  a nobis ipsum nolle putate coli. 50
```

- I think that *coli* is from *colo, colere, colui, cultus*, meaning to
  cultivate/care for.

  proclaiming in the middle of the road that he earned it.

```
talia caelestes fieri praeconia gaudent, 55
  ut sua, quid valeant numina, teste probent.
```

- Gaertner tells me to translate *probent* as prove.
- Ehhhh, I hate my translation. Plus I put *sua* into the *quid* clause, which
  seems like I'm stretching it.
- The divinities are glad that such proclamations happen, so that they may
  prove with a witness how their own divine wills are strong.

```
saepe levant poenas ereptaque lumina reddunt,
  cum bene peccati paenituisse vident.
```

- *cum* clause!
- *paenituisse* apparently takes the genitive.
- often they will lift the penalty and return the having been snatched away
  eye, when they see that he repented well of the offense.

  paenitet, et facto torqueor ipse meo. 60

cumque sit exilium, magis est mihi culpa dolori,
  estque pati poenam quam meruisse minus.
```

- Ended here April 13th.

While exile is a source of my distress, a still greater source is my guilt, and
the fact that I suffer punishment grieves me less than the fact that I deserved
it.

```
ut mihi di faveant, quibus est manifestior ipse,
  poena potest demi, culpa perennis erit.
```

Even supposing that the gods, whom he himself surpasses in manifest presence,
should be favourable towards me, the punishment can be removed, but the guilt
will be everlasting.

```
[mors faciet certe, ne sim, cum venerit, exul;
  ut non peccarim, mors quoque non faciet.
```

[Death will certainly bring it about that, when it will have come, I shall not
be an exile any more; but even death will not bring about that I have not
sinned.

estur ut occulta vitiata teredine navis,
  aequorei scopulos ut cavat unda salis,
roditur ut scabra positum rubigine ferrum,
  conditus ut tineae carpitur ore liber,
sic mea perpetuos curarum pectora morsus,
  fine quibus nullo conficiantur, habent.
```
```
nec prius hi mentem stimuli, quam vita relinquet,
