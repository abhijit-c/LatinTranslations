# Fabio Maximo

```
Maxime, qui tanti mensuram nominis imples
  et geminas animi nobilitate genus,
qui nasci ut posses, quamvis cecidere trecenti,
  non omnis Fabios abstulit una dies,
forsitan, haec a quo mittatur epistula, quaeras,
  quisque loquar tecum, certior esse velis.
```

- O Maximus, you who fill up the measure of so great a name and double the force
  of your descent by your nobility of mind, who so that you are able to be born,
  although 300 fell, one day did not carry away all the Fabians, perhaps you
  might seek, from whom this epistulae was sent, and who is speaking with you,
  you wish to be more certain.

```
ei mihi, quid faciam? vereor, ne nomine lecto
  durus et aversa cetera mente legas.
```

- Note on *aversa* meaning hostile here.
- Woe to me, what will I do? I fear, lest you, with my name having been read,
  read the rest with a harsh and hostile mind.

```
videris: audebo tibi me scripsisse fateri
........................................ 
qui, cum me poena dignum graviore fuisse
  confitear, possum vix graviora pati.
```

- Concessive *cum*.
- *poena* reduplicated as *poenas* after *pati*.
- You will have seen: I will dare to confess that I wrote it to you, (...)
  I who, although I confess that I have been worth of a heavy penalty, am hardly
  able to suffer a more heavy penalty.

```
hostibus in mediis interque pericula versor
  (tamquam cum patria pax sit adempta mihi),
qui, mortis saevo geminent ut vulnere causas,
  omnia vipereo spicula felle linunt.
```

- TODO
- (just as when peace has been withdrawn from my homeland for me.)
- (just as with my country peace has been withdrawn from me.)
- enemies who so that they double the causes of death witha a cruel wound they
  daub all their sharp points with viper venom.

I am in the middle of enemies and in the midst of perils (as if, together with
my native country, peace, too, has been taken away from me),
(15) enemies who dip the sharp points of all their arrows in viper venom in
order to double the causes of death by a cruel wound.

```
his eques instructus perterrita moenia lustrat
  more lupi clausas circumeuntis oves,
et semel intentus nervo levis arcus equino
vincula semper habens inresoluta manet.
```

- TODO
Equipped with these weapons horsemen ride around the terrified city walls, like
a wolf circling sheep which are shut up, and once the light bow has been bent
with its horse-tendon string
(20) it so remains, always keeping its fastenings unloosened.

```
tecta rigent fixis veluti vallata sagittis,
  portaque vix firma summovet arma sera.
```

- Just as the having been surrounded roofs are stiff with having been fixed
  arrows, and the door hardly prevents the armed troops with its firm bar.


Like a wall with palisades the rooftops bristle with arrows, which have been
shot into them, and although shut with a secure bar, the door can hardly keep
out the armed enemies.

```
adde loci faciem nec fronde nec arbore tecti
  et quod iners hiemi continuatur hiems.
```

- Tissol wants *quod* as 'the fact that', but couldn't find any evidence on
  L&S, so just going with 'because'.
- *continuatur* takes the dative, here *hiemi*.
- add the appearance of the place, having been covered neither by leaves nor
  by a tree, and because inert winter is continued by winter.

```
hic me pugnantem cum frigore cumque sagittis 25
  cumque meo fato quarta fatigat hiems.
```

- Main clause is *hic quarta hiems fatigat me*.
- Note *pugnantem* from *pugno* frequently constructed with *cum*.
- Here the fourth winter tires me, fighting with the cold and with the arrows
  and with my fate.

```
fine carent lacrimae, nisi cum stupor obstitit illis
  et similis morti pectora torpor habet.
```

- *carent* from *careo* frequently constructed with ablative, here *fine*.
- *obstitit* from *obsto* frequently constructed with dative, here *illis*.
- My tears are without an end, unless when numbness stands before them and
  torpor, similar to death, holds my breast.

```
felicem Nioben, quamvis tot funera vidit,
  quae posuit sensum saxea facta mali. 30
```

- *Nioben* greek accusative.
- Happy Niobe, albiet the so many funerals she saw, who, having been made into
  stones, put aside the feeling of misfortune.

```
vos quoque felices, quarum clamantia fratrem
  cortice velavit populus ora novo.
```

- *clamantia* as 'shouting the name of' thanks to Tissol.
- likewise happy you, the mouths of whose, shouting the name of the your
  brother, the poplar veiled with new bark.

```
ille ego sum, lignum qui non admittor in ullum;
  ille ego sum, frustra qui lapis esse velim.
```

- What? Ovid, I'm losing you.
- I am that man, who is not admitted into any wood; I am that man, who in vain
  wishes to be a stone.

```
[ipsa Medusa oculis veniat licet obvia nostris, 35
  amittet vires ipsa Medusa suas.]
```

- *licet* + subjunctive = 'even if', L&S.
- *obvia* takes the dative, L&S.
- [Even if Medisa herself comes in the way of our eyes, Medusa herself will lose
  her own strength.]

```
vivimus, ut numquam sensu careamus amaro,
  et gravior longa fit mea poena mora.
```

- *fio* takes predicate nominative because it's copulative.
- We live, in order to never be without bitter feeling, and my penalty is made
  more grave in its long delay.

```
sic inconsumptum Tityi semperque renascens
non perit, ut possit saepe perire, iecur. 40
```

- Thus the unconsumed and always being born again liver of Tityus does not die,
  so that it is able to die often.

```
at, puto, cum requies medicinaque publica curae
  Somnus adest, solitis Nox venit orba malis.
```

- Tissol *publica* as 'avaliable to all'. I think this is a problem of English.
- The pentameter is DDDD. Scansion reveals *orba* to be accusative plural.
- but, I think, when common sleep, the rest and medicine of concern, is near,
  night comes bereft from the usual misfortunes.

```
somnia me terrent veros imitantia casus,
  et vigilant sensus in mea damna mei.
```

- It must be the accusative *in*, which I translate as *to* going by Tissol's
  suggestion and what fits in english.
- Dreams imitating true calamities terrify me, and the senses of mine are
  vigilant to my own harm.

```
aut ego Sarmaticas videor vitare sagittas, 45
  aut dare captivas ad fera vincla manus,
aut, ubi decipior melioris imagine somni,
  aspicio patriae tecta relicta meae
et modo vobiscum, quos sum veneratus, amici,
  et modo cum cara coniuge multa loquor. 50
```

- *loquor* the verb for line 49.
- Either I seem to avoid the Sarmatian arrows, or to give hands captive to wild
  chains, or, when I am deceived by the image of a good sleep, I gaze at the
  having been left behind houses of my homeland and lately I speak with you all
  of my friends, whom I venerate, and lately I speak many things with my dear
  wife.

```
sic ubi percepta est brevis et non vera voluptas,
  peior ab admonitu fit status ipse boni.
```

- Thus when I have percieved brief and not true pleasure, my very status 
  becomes more bad by the reminder of a good thing.

```
sive dies igitur caput hoc miserabile cernit,
  sive pruinosi Noctis aguntur equi,
sic mea perpetuis liquefiunt pectora curis, 55
  ignibus admotis ut nova cera solet.
```

- Start here April 22.
- Have to reverse the word order for 56 in order for it to make English sense.
- Whether, therefore, the sunlight discerns this miserable head, or the frosty
  horses of night are driven, thus my heart is melted by continuous concern, as
  new wax is accustomed to with fire having been brought near.

```
saepe precor mortem, mortem quoque deprecor idem,
  ne mea Sarmaticum contegat ossa solum.
```

- Often I pray for death, likewise I avert by prayer the same death, lest the
  Sarmatian ground conceals my bones.

```
cum subit, Augusti quae sit clementia, credo
  mollia naufragiis litora posse dari. 60
````

- RELATIVE CLAUSE OF CHARACTERISTIC.
- when it approaches to me, what the clemency of Augustus is, I trust that my
  shipwreck is able to be given to the soft shores.

```
cum video, quam sint mea fata tenacia, frangor,
  spesque levis magno victa timore cadit,
nec tamen ulterius quicquam sperove precorve,
  quam male munito posse carere loco.
```
```
aut hoc aut nihil est, pro me temptare modeste 65
  gratia quod salvo vestra pudore queat.
```
```
suscipe, Romanae facundia, Maxime, linguae,
  difficilis causae mite patrocinium.
```
```
est mala, confiteor, sed te bona fiet agente:
  lenia pro misera fac modo verba fuga. 70
```
```
nescit enim Caesar, quamvis deus omnia norit,
  ultimus hic qua sit condicione locus.
```
```
magna tenent illud numen molimina rerum:
  haec est caelesti pectore cura minor.
```

- TODO

Great undertakings occupy his divine mind: this concern is too small to be of
interest to his heavenly soul.

```
nec vacat, in qua sint positi regione Tomitae, 75
  quaerere (finitimo vix loca nota Getae),
aut quid Sauromatae faciant, quid Iazyges acres
  cultaque Oresteae Taurica terra deae,
quaeque aliae gentes, ubi frigore constitit Hister,
  dura meant celeri terga per amnis equo. 80
```

- *in...Tomitae* indirect question.
- *Getae* has to be nominative, but *loca* doesn't match case, and therefore it
  accusative. Implicit *sunt* fitting with *nota*. NO! *Geta, Getae*. TOFIX.
- Weird translation of *nota* as 'become acquainted with'.
- *culta* in apposition to *Taurica terra*, *oresteae deae* dative of agent b/c
  of *culta* p.p.p. Also reduplicate *faciant*.
- Why is it *quaeque* not *quidque*? Theory: *quid* is implied by wanting
  a tricolon structure, *quae* instead is relative leading into the *ubi* clause
  and *dura...equo* explaination. Confirmed.
- The Hister is the latin name for the (lower) Danube, huge European river.
- Nor is he idle to ask in which region the peoples of Tomis were placed (the
  Getae hardly were acquainted with the places), or what the Sauromatae are 
  doing, what the bitter Iazyges and the Taurician land, having been cultivated
  by the Orestean gods, are doing, and what the other tribes who, when the Hister
  halted because of the frost, travel with a swift horse through the hard backs
  of the river.

```
maxima pars horum nec te, pulcherrima, curat,
  Roma, nec Ausonii militis arma timet.
```

- Shouldn't *plcherrima Roma* be accusative, to be in apposition with *te*?
- A very large part of these people neither care about you, the most beautiful
  Rome, nor fear the arms of the Ausonian soldier.

```
dant illis animos arcus plenaeque pharetrae
  quamque libet longis cursibus aptus equus,
quodque sitim didicere diu tolerare famemque, 85
  quodque sequens nullas hostis habebit aquas.
```

- *quamque libet* as *que + quamlibet* (Timesis).
- Bows and full quivers give spirit to those people and a horse suitable for
  a running however long, and because they learned to tolerate hunger and thirst
  and because an enemy following will have no water.

```
ira viri mitis non me misisset in istam,
  si satis haec illi nota fuisset humus.
```

- Start here April 28.
- Notice *istam*, negative emphasis.
- Conditional with pluperfect subjunctive, means past contrary-to-fact.
- The anger of the mild man would not have sent me into that, if this land had
  been sufficiently known to that man.

```
nec me nec quemquam Romanum gaudet ab hoste
  (meque minus, vitam cui dedit ipse) capi. 90
```

- Ehhh these *nec*'s are weird.
- Neither is he glad that I nor any Roman is being seized by the enemy (and me
  less, to whom he himself gave life).
- he is glad that neither I nor any Roman is being seized by the enemy (and me
  less, to whom he himself gave life).

```
noluit, ut poterat, minimo me perdere nutu:
  nil opus est ullis in mea fata Getis.
```

- *opus est* a construction meaning 'it is beneficial'.
- He did not wish to ruin me with the smallest nod, although he was able to:
  It is not beneficial for any Geta in my fate.

```
sed neque, cur morerer, quicquam mihi comperit actum,
  et minus infestus, quam fuit, esse potest.
```

- EHHHHHHHHHHHH.
- But nor did he learn of any act from me on account of which I should die, and
  he can be less hostile than he had been.

```
tunc quoque nil fecit, nisi quod facere ipse coegi; 95
  paene etiam merito parcior ira meo est.
```

- More EHHHHH.
- Even then he did not do it, except what I myself compelled him to do; and also
  his anger is nearly more restrained than having been earned by me.

```
di faciant igitur, quorum iustissimus ipse est,
  alma nihil maius Caesare terra ferat,
utque diu sub eo, sic sit sub Caesare semper,
  perque manus huius tradita gentis eat. 100
```

- WEIRD
- *facio* can take subjunctive.
- therefore let the gods, of whom he himself is most just, make it that the
  nourishing ground does not bring a thing greater than Caesar, and that as it
  is under him for a long time, thus it may be under Caesar always, and that
  it walks through the hands of this clan, having been handed over.


```
at tu tam placido, quam nos quoque sensimus illum,
  iudice pro lacrimis ora resolve meis.
```

- TODO

But you, given that he is such a mild judge as I, too, have experienced, open
your mouth on behalf of your weeping friend.

```
non petito bene sit, sed uti male tutius, utque
  exilium saevo distet ab hoste meum,
quamque dedere mihi praesentia numina vitam, 105
  non adimat stricto squalidus ense Getes,
denique, si moriar, subeam pacatius arvum,
  ossa nec a Scythica nostra premantur humo,
nec male compositos, ut scilicet exule dignum,
  Bistonii cineres ungula pulset equi, 110
et ne, si superest aliquis post funera sensus,
  terreat et Manes Sarmatis umbra meos.
```

- TODO: Start here April 29

- don't seek that it is well, but that I am not well safely, and that my exile
  is distant from a savage enemy, and no squalid Geta

Do not ask that I may be happy, but that I may feel distressed in greater
safety, and that my place of exile may be distant from the savage enemy, and
that no squalid Geta may take away by his drawn sword the life which the
manifest deities have granted me, and finally ask that, if I die, I may be
buried in a more peaceful soil, and that my bones may not be pressed down by the
Scythian ground, and that the hoof of the Bistonian horse may not trample upon
my ashes, ill-buried (as is, of course, worthy of an exile), and that—if there
remains any bit of consciousness after death—a Sarmatian shadow may not terrify
my ghost.

```
Caesaris haec animum poterant audita movere,
  Maxime, movissent si tamen ante tuum.
```

- these things having been heard were able to move the mind of Caesar,
  yet if they had previously moved your (mind), Maxmimus,

Once heard, these things would have the power to move the mind of Caesar if
only, Maximus, they had moved your mind before.

```
