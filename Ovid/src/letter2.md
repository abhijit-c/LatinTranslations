# Fabio Maximo

```
Maxime, qui tanti mensuram nominis imples
  et geminas animi nobilitate genus,
qui nasci ut posses, quamvis cecidere trecenti,
  non omnis Fabios abstulit una dies,
forsitan, haec a quo mittatur epistula, quaeras,
  quisque loquar tecum, certior esse velis.
```

Maximus, you who fill the measure of such a big name and you who double noble
descent by nobility of mind, and, to allow whose birth, one single day—even
though 300 fell—did not carry off all the Fabians, maybe you ask from whom this
letter is sent and you wish to know who is conversing with you.

```
ei mihi, quid faciam? vereor, ne nomine lecto
  durus et aversa cetera mente legas.
```

Oh dear, what shall I do? I fear that, after reading my name, you may read the
rest of the letter with a hard and unfavourable disposition.

```
videris: audebo tibi me scripsisse fateri
qui, cum me poena dignum graviore fuisse
  confitear, possum vix graviora pati.
```

You shall see: I will dare to tell you that I have written the letter,
I who admit that I have deserved an even harsher punishment but at
the same time can hardly endure circumstances which are harder than these.

```
hostibus in mediis interque pericula versor
  (tamquam cum patria pax sit adempta mihi),
qui, mortis saevo geminent ut vulnere causas,
  omnia vipereo spicula felle linunt.
```

I am in the middle of enemies and in the midst of perils (as if, together with
my native country, peace, too, has been taken away from me),
(15) enemies who dip the sharp points of all their arrows in viper venom in
order to double the causes of death by a cruel wound.

```
his eques instructus perterrita moenia lustrat
  more lupi clausas circumeuntis oves,
et semel intentus nervo levis arcus equino
vincula semper habens inresoluta manet.
```

Equipped with these weapons horsemen ride around the terrified city walls, like
a wolf circling sheep which are shut up, and once the light bow has been bent
with its horse-tendon string
(20) it so remains, always keeping its fastenings unloosened.

```
tecta rigent fixis veluti vallata sagittis,
  portaque vix firma summovet arma sera.
```

Like a wall with palisades the rooftops bristle with arrows, which have been
shot into them, and although shut with a secure bar, the door can hardly keep
out the armed enemies.
