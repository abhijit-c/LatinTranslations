# Fabio Maximo

```
Maxime, qui tanti mensuram nominis imples
  et geminas animi nobilitate genus,
qui nasci ut posses, quamvis cecidere trecenti,
  non omnis Fabios abstulit una dies,
forsitan, haec a quo mittatur epistula, quaeras,
  quisque loquar tecum, certior esse velis.
```

- O Maximus, you who fill up the measure of so great a name and double the force
  of your descent by your nobility of mind, who so that you are able to be born,
  although 300 fell, one day did not carry away all the Fabians, perhaps you
  might seek, from whom this epistulae was sent, and who is speaking with you,
  you wish to be more certain.

```
ei mihi, quid faciam? vereor, ne nomine lecto
  durus et aversa cetera mente legas.
```

- Note on *aversa* meaning hostile here.
- Woe to me, what will I do? I fear, lest you, with my name having been read,
  read the rest with a harsh and hostile mind.

```
videris: audebo tibi me scripsisse fateri
........................................ 
qui, cum me poena dignum graviore fuisse
  confitear, possum vix graviora pati.
```

- Concessive *cum*.
- *poena* reduplicated as *poenas* after *pati*.
- You will have seen: I will dare to confess that I wrote it to you, (...)
  I who, although I confess that I have been worth of a heavy penalty, am hardly
  able to suffer a more heavy penalty.

```
hostibus in mediis interque pericula versor
  (tamquam cum patria pax sit adempta mihi),
qui, mortis saevo geminent ut vulnere causas,
  omnia vipereo spicula felle linunt.
```

- TODO
- (just as when peace has been withdrawn from my homeland for me.)
- (just as with my country peace has been withdrawn from me.)
- enemies who so that they double the causes of death witha a cruel wound they
  daub all their sharp points with viper venom.

I am in the middle of enemies and in the midst of perils (as if, together with
my native country, peace, too, has been taken away from me),
(15) enemies who dip the sharp points of all their arrows in viper venom in
order to double the causes of death by a cruel wound.

```
his eques instructus perterrita moenia lustrat
  more lupi clausas circumeuntis oves,
et semel intentus nervo levis arcus equino
vincula semper habens inresoluta manet.
```

- TODO
Equipped with these weapons horsemen ride around the terrified city walls, like
a wolf circling sheep which are shut up, and once the light bow has been bent
with its horse-tendon string
(20) it so remains, always keeping its fastenings unloosened.

```
tecta rigent fixis veluti vallata sagittis,
  portaque vix firma summovet arma sera.
```

- Just as the having been surrounded roofs are stiff with having been fixed
  arrows, and the door hardly prevents the armed troops with its firm bar.


Like a wall with palisades the rooftops bristle with arrows, which have been
shot into them, and although shut with a secure bar, the door can hardly keep
out the armed enemies.

```
adde loci faciem nec fronde nec arbore tecti
  et quod iners hiemi continuatur hiems.
```

- Tissol wants *quod* as 'the fact that', but couldn't find any evidence on
  L&S, so just going with 'because'.
- *continuatur* takes the dative, here *hiemi*.
- add the appearance of the place, having been covered neither by leaves nor
  by a tree, and because inert winter is continued by winter.

```
hic me pugnantem cum frigore cumque sagittis 25
  cumque meo fato quarta fatigat hiems.
```

- Main clause is *hic quarta hiems fatigat me*.
- Note *pugnantem* from *pugno* frequently constructed with *cum*.
- Here the fourth winter tires me, fighting with the cold and with the arrows
  and with my fate.

```
fine carent lacrimae, nisi cum stupor obstitit illis
  et similis morti pectora torpor habet.
```

- *carent* from *careo* frequently constructed with ablative, here *fine*.
- *obstitit* from *obsto* frequently constructed with dative, here *illis*.
- My tears are without an end, unless when numbness stands before them and
  torpor, similar to death, holds my breast.

```
felicem Nioben, quamvis tot funera vidit,
  quae posuit sensum saxea facta mali. 30
```

- *Nioben* greek accusative.
- Happy Niobe, albiet the so many funerals she saw, who, having been made into
  stones, put aside the feeling of misfortune.

```
vos quoque felices, quarum clamantia fratrem
  cortice velavit populus ora novo.
```

- *clamantia* as 'shouting the name of' thanks to Tissol.
- likewise happy you, the mouths of whose, shouting the name of the your
  brother, the poplar veiled with new bark.

```
ille ego sum, lignum qui non admittor in ullum;
  ille ego sum, frustra qui lapis esse velim.
```

- What? Ovid, I'm losing you.
- I am that man, who is not admitted into any wood; I am that man, who in vain
  wishes to be a stone.

```
[ipsa Medusa oculis veniat licet obvia nostris, 35
  amittet vires ipsa Medusa suas.]
```

- *licet* + subjunctive = 'even if', L&S.
- *obvia* takes the dative, L&S.
- [Even if Medisa herself comes in the way of our eyes, Medusa herself will lose
  her own strength.]

```
vivimus, ut numquam sensu careamus amaro,
  et gravior longa fit mea poena mora.
```

- We live, in order to never be without bitter feeling, and more grave my
  penalty is made in its long delay.

```
sic inconsumptum Tityi semperque renascens
non perit, ut possit saepe perire, iecur. 40
```


In the same manner the unconsumed and ever-regrowing liver of Tityus does not
perish in order that it can perish repeatedly.

```
at, puto, cum requies medicinaque publica curae
  Somnus adest, solitis Nox venit orba malis.
```

'But', one might say, 'when Sleep, the rest and medicine
of sorrow which is available to everyone, is there, Night comes free from the
usual hardships.'

```
somnia me terrent veros imitantia casus,
  et vigilant sensus in mea damna mei.
```

Dreams which imitate reality terrify me, and my senses remain
awake to my own harm.

```
aut ego Sarmaticas videor vitare sagittas, 45
  aut dare captivas ad fera vincla manus,
aut, ubi decipior melioris imagine somni,
  aspicio patriae tecta relicta meae
et modo vobiscum, quos sum veneratus, amici,
et modo cum cara coniuge multa loquor. 50
```

Either I seem to dodge Sarmatian arrows or to submit
captive hands to cruel chains, or when I am deceived by the image of a more
kindly dream, I visit the houses of my home country, which I left behind, and
I talk a lot, now with you my friends whom I revere, now with my dear wife.

```
sic ubi percepta est brevis et non vera voluptas,
  peior ab admonitu fit status ipse boni.
```

Once I have enjoyed brief but false pleasure in this manner, my situation
becomes even worse through the remembrance of something good.

```
sive dies igitur caput hoc miserabile cernit,
  sive pruinosi Noctis aguntur equi,
sic mea perpetuis liquefiunt pectora curis, 55
  ignibus admotis ut nova cera solet.
```

Thus, be it that
daylight looks down on this miserable head, be it that Night drives her frosty
horses, my heart melts from permanent sorrows just as new wax tends to melt,
when fire is moved near it.

```
saepe precor mortem, mortem quoque deprecor idem,
  ne mea Sarmaticum contegat ossa solum.
```

Often I wish for death, but death I also wish away
in order that the Sarmatian soil may not cover my bones.

```
cum subit, Augusti quae sit clementia, credo
  mollia naufragiis litora posse dari. 60
````

When it comes to my mind what Augustus' clemency is like, I believe that my
wrecked ship can land on a soft shore.
