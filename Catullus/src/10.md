# (10) A bad moment with Varus and his girl

| *Varus me meus ad suos amores*
| *visum duxerat e foro otiosum:*

- *duxerat* from *duco, ducere, duxi, ductus* is 3rd singular pluperfect active
  indicative, meaning to lead.
- I think that *visum* (from *video, videre, vidi, visus*) is the supine of
  *duxerat*, and that *otiosum* is modifying *visum*, since they're the only
  things which match in case.

      My Varus had led me, at leisure, to his loves out of the forum to see
      them.

| *scortillum (ut mihi tum repente visum est)*
| *non sane illepidum neque invenustum;*

- *visum est* from *video, videre, vidi, visus* is 3rd singular perfect passive
  indicative, meaning to see.
- *ut* in the conjunctive usage.
- Double negative here, litotes.

      A little harlot (as then it suddenly seemed to me) not reasonably lacking
      grace nor unlovely;

| *huc ut venimus, incidere nobis*
| *sermones varii, in quibus quid esset*
| *iam Bithnyia, quo modo se haberet,*
| *et quonam mihi profuisset aere.*

- *venimus* from *venio, venire, veni, ventus* is 1st plural perfect active
  indicative, meaning to come.
- *incidere* from *incido, incidere, incidi, incasus* is the 3rd plural perfect
  active indicative, meaning to fall upon.
- *esset* is 3rd singular imperfect active subjunctive. I think indirect
  question?
- *haberet* from *habeo, habere, habui, habitus* is 3rd singular imperfect
  active subjunctive, meaning to hold.
- *profuisset* from *prosum, prodesse, profui, profuturus* is 3rd singular
  pluperfect active subjunctive, meaning to be useful (with DAT).
- Note that *-nam* is a suffix of this relative, like
- *aere* is an ablative of means.

      as we came to this place, various conversations fell upon us, in which what
      was Bithnyia now, in what manner was it holding itself, and it had
      profitited me with whatever money.

| *Respondi id quod erat:*

- *respondi* from *respondeo, respondere, respondi, responsus* is 1st singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to answer.
- *id quod erat* I have no clue.

      I answered that which was:

|                        *nihil neque ipsis*
| *nec praetoribus esse nec cohorti,*
| *cur quisquam caput unctius referret:*

- *esse* likely is setting off indirect speech, with 
- *ipsis, praetoribus,* and *cohorti* is a tricolon of dative of references.
- *referret* from *refero, referre, rettuli, relatus* is 3rd singular imperfect
  active subjunctive, meaning to bring back. This is subjunctive likely because
  it's an indirect question.

      That there was nothing neither for themselves nor for the praetors nor for
      the court, why anyone might bring back a greasy head:

      That neither themselves nor the praetors nor the court had anything, why
      anyone might bring back a more oily head:

| *praesertim quibus esset irrumator*
| *praetor, nec faceret pili cohortem.*

- *esset* is subjunctive, likely in a relative clause of characteristic,
  functioning off of the implied indefinite antecedent *ipsis*.
- *faceret* is also subjunctive, fitting into the same relative clause of
  characteristic as *esset*.
- *pili* is a genitive of value.

      especially to those of the sort whom the praetor was a vile person, nor
      was he making the cohort worth of a hair?

| *"At certe tamen," inquiunt "quod illic*
| *natum dicitur esse, comparasti*
| *ad lecticam homines."*

- *inquiunt* from *inquit* is 3rd plural present active indicative, meaning to
  say.

      "But surely nevertheless" they say "that which is said to be born there,
      you obtained the man towards the litter."

|                       *Ego (ut puellae*
| *unum me facerem beatiorem)*
| *"Non" inquam "mihi tam fuit maligne,*
| *ut, provincia quod mala incidisset,*
| *non possem octo homines parare rector."*
