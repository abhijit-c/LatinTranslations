# Book I

```
Aeneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,
alma Venus, caeli subter labentia signa
quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferentis
concelebras, per te quoniam genus omne animantum
concipitur visitque exortum lumina solis: 5
```

- Note *Aeneadum* is genitive, see the commentary. By the same note in the
  commentary, certainly *divom* would make sense as a genitive plural, so I do
  that here, in order to be consistant with the translation.
- For *caeli* to the end of line 3 to make sense, look forward to *concelebras*.
- *frugiferentis* is accusative alternative ending.
- *concipitur* as 'is formed' via the commentary.

      O mother of Aeneadian people, the darling of men and gods, nourishing
      Venus, you, beneath the gliding signs of the sky, who celebrate the
      ship-bearing sea, who celebrate the fruitful earth, because through you
      each kind of animating things is formed and visits the lights of the sun:

```
te, dea, te fugiunt venti, te nubila caeli
adventumque tuum, tibi suavis daedala tellus
summittit flores, tibi rident aequora ponti
placatumque nitet diffuso lumine caelum.
```

- This was pretty easy.
- Does *suavis* and *daedala* both modify *tellus*, or does one modify *flores*?
  Because both can.

      O goddess, the winds flee from you, the clouds flee from you and your
      arrival, for you pleasant skillful earth emits flowers, for you the smooth
      surfaces of the sea laugh and and the sky, having been appeased, shines
      with having been diffused light.

```
nam simul ac species patefactast verna diei 10
et reserata viget genitabilis aura favoni,
aeriae primum volucris te, diva, tuumque
significant initum perculsae corda tua vi.
```

- *patefactast* is from *patefacio*, and is the perfect passive.
- *favoni* from *favonius* is the word for the west wind. 2nd declension.
- What the hell is *genitabilis*? I don't know, I think it's 'productive'.

      For as the same time with the appearance of the day of spring having been
      revealed and with the breeze of the productive west wind having been
      opened up is thriving, the bird of the sky, o goddess, [...]


and for as soon as the vernal face of day was revealed, the breeze of the
fruitful west wind having been unsealed is thriving, the airy birds having been
struck through their hearts as to your strength show first (signs) of you and
your approach, goddess.


```
inde ferae pecudes persultant pabula laeta 15
et rapidos tranant amnis: 
```

from that place herds and wild beasts leap over in fertile pastures and swim
over rapid rivers:

```
                         ita capta lepore
te sequitur cupide quo quamque inducere pergis.
```

in this way seized by your charm, each one follows eagerly you (where) you
continue to lead each one.

- Ended here May 28.

```
denique per maria ac montis fluviosque rapacis
frondiferasque domos avium camposque virentis
omnibus incutiens blandum per pectora amorem
efficis ut cupide generatim saecla propagent. 20
```

then through sea and mountains, tearing rivers and leaf-bearing homes of birds,
and thriving fields

striking enticing love through the hearts of all so that you make bring them
about to reproduce eagerly kind by kind.


```
quae quoniam rerum naturam sola gubernas
nec sine te quicquam dias in luminis oras
exoritur neque fit laetum neque amabile quicquam,
```

and since you alone control the nature of (these) things, nor without you (does)
anything divine happen to come to being into the shores of light, and not
anything happy nor lovable,


```
te sociam studeo scribendis versibus esse,
quos ego de rerum natura pangere conor 25
Memmiadae nostro, quem tu, dea, tempore in omni
omnibus ornatum voluisti excellere rebus.
```

I desire you as an ally for the writing of my verses which I try to compose on
the nature of things for our Memmeus, whom you, goddess,

distinguished (him) in all things for all time want to excel.

```
quo magis aeternum da dictis, diva, leporem.
```

therefore give more eternal charm to the words, goddess.

```
effice ut interea fera moenera militiai
per maria ac terras omnis sopita quiescant; 30
```
meanwhile bring about that harsh duties of warfare through all seas and lands
rest lulled to sleep.
