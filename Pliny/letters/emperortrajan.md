1. *Sollemne est mihi, domine, omnia de quibus dubito ad te referre.*

  meaning to doubt.

    I doubt.

2. *Quis enim potest melius uel cunctationem meam regere uel ignorantiam
   instruere?*

- *quis* is the interrogative pronoun here, and it's nominative with antecedent
  being the *domine*.

    ignorance?

   aut puniri soleat aut quaeri.*

- *interfui* from *intersum, interesse, interfui, interfuturus* is 1st singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to be/lie between. This takes a dative
  (*cognitionibus*) and is translated as 'I am present/attend (+ dat.)' in that

  infinitive, meaning to seek.

    I have never attended examinations concerning Christians: therefore I do not
    know what and to what extent it is accustomed to either punished or be
    sought out.

- *haesitaui* from *haesito, haesitare* is 1st singular perfect active
  indicative, meaning to hesitate.
- *sit* from *sum, esse, fui, futurus* is 3rd singular present active
  subjunctive. This is given in the form *sitne*, which according to Lewis and
  Short, when you combine *-ne* with a subjunctive it turns into the question of
  'whether'. This is subjunctive because it's a indirect question.
- *differant* from *differo, differre, distuli, dilatus* is 3rd plural present
  active subjunctive, meaning to differ. This is subjunctive because it's
  a indirect question.

   puniantur.*
