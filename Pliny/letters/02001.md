# (I) C. PLINIVS ROMANO SVO S.

1. *Post aliquot[^1] annos insigne atque etiam memorabile populi Romani oculis
   spectaculum exhibuit publicum funus[^2] Vergini Rufi[^3], maximi et
   clarissimi ciuis, perinde felicis.*

- *aliquot* is undeclined; here fitting on *annos* inside the *post*.
- *oculis* is a dative of indirect object.
- *exhibuit* from *exhibeo, exhibere, exhibui, exhibitus* is 3rd singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to present.
- *maximi et clarissimi ciuis* is a partitive genitive.

      After several years the public funeral of the equally fortunate Verinus
      Rufus, one of the greatest and brightest citizen, presented a conspicuous
      and even memorable spectacle to the eyes of the Roman people.

[^1]: **post aliquot annos:** i.e., it was several years since an occurance as
  memorable as that about to be mentioned. Verginius' death occured at the end
  of 97 AD.
[^2]: **publicum funus:** a signal honor, voted by the senate; the expense was
  defrayed sometimes by the public treasury, sometimes by voluntary
  contributions.
[^3]: **Vergini Rufi**: The 'grand old man' of that generation, consul for the
  third time in 97, as colleague of the emperor Nerva; he had been Pliny's
  guardian. **perinde felicis:** *not less fortunate*.

2. *Triginta annis[^4] gloriae suae superuixit; legit scripta de se carmina, legit
   historias[^5] et posteritati suae interfuit[^6].*

- *superuixit* from *supervivo, supervivere, supervixi* is 3rd singular perfect
  active indicative, meaning to survive. Takes the dative: *gloriae suae*.
- *legit* from *lego, legere, legi, lectus* is 3rd singular perfect active
  indicative, meaning to read.
- *scripta* from *scribo, scribere, scripsi, scriptus* is the p.p.p., meaning to
  write. This is modifying *carmina*.
- *interfuit* from *intersum, interesse* is 3rd singular perfect active
  indicative, meaning to take part in. Takes the dative *posteritati suae*.

    He survived his own glory within a period of 30 years; he read songs having
    been written about himself, he read histories and took part in his own
    legacies.

[^4]: **triginta annis:** ablative of duration of time, a construction which
  increases in frequency in the post-Augustan age. In both the elder and
  younger Pliny it almost entirely supplants the accusative of duration.
  **gloriae...supervixit:** *lived to enjoy his fame*.
[^5]: **historias:** in this connection it is intereting to read Ep. IX.19.
[^6]: **interfuit:** *learned the verdict of*.

   impleret[^7], cum principis noluisset.*

  perfect indicative, meaning to perform. This takes the ablative *tertio
  consulatu*.

  active subjunctive, meaning to fulfill. This is a final clause.

  subjunctive, meaning to wish not to.

    He performed a 3rd consulship, so that he might fulfill the highest honor of
    a private man, since he had not wanted the honor of the princeps.

[^7]: **fastigum...impleret:** a mixed metaphor. **privati hominis:** *of
  a subject*. **cum principis noluisset:** he had refused the purple after
  defeating Julius Vindex in 68, again after Galba's accession, the third time
  after Ortho's defeat at Bedriacum in 69. Juvenal VII.211, *quid enum Verginus
  armis. Debuit ulcisci magic, aut cum Vindice Galba.*

4. *Caesares[^8] quibus suspectus atque etiam inuisus uirtutibus[^9] fuerat
   euasit, reliquit incolumem optimum atque amicissimum, tamquam ad hunc ipsum

    He evaded the Caesars by whom he had been suspected and even envied for his
    virtues, he left behind safe the best and friendliest Caesar, as if he had
    been reserved to this very honor of a public funeral.

[^8]: **Caesares:** Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian; the use of
  a personal direct object of *evadere* is noteworthy.
[^9]: **virtutibus:** causal. **optimum:** Nerva.

   ueneratione.*

  active indicative, meaning to pass.

    tremble, yet short of pain.

    Only the approach of death was harder and longer, but in this moment he
    himself was praiseworthy.

   forte acceperat grandiorem, et seni et stanti ipso pondere elapsus est.*

- *praepararet* from *praeparo, praeparare* is 3rd singular imperfect active
  subjunctive, meaning to prepare. This is subjunctive because it's in
  a circumstancial *cum* clause.

  meaning to give thanks (fitting with *gratias*).

    away because of its very weight from both an old and standing man.

9. *Hunc dum sequitur colligitque, per leue et lubricum pauimentum fallente

    foro et rostris attulerunt.*

  active indicative, meaning to carry.

    The funeral rites of this man brought great decoration to the princeps, to

    touch added to his good fortune, the praiser was very eloquent.

12. *Et ille quidem plenus annis abit, plenus honoribus, illis etiam quos
    recusauit:*

- Instead of *plenus* modifying *ille*, given the parallel structure with
  *plenus honoribus*, I think it's its own thing, i.e. 'full with age, full with
  honor'.
- *abit* from *abeo, abire, abivi, abitus* is 3rd singular present active
  indicative, meaning to depart.
- *recusauit* from *recuso, recusare, recusavi, recusatus* is 3rd singular

  honors even though he had rejeceted many.

    and indeed that man died full with years full with honors, even those which
    he rejected.

13. *nobis tamen quaerendus ac desiderandus est ut exemplar aeui prioris, mihi
    uero praecipue, qui illum non solum publice quantum admirabar tantum
    diligebam;*

  indicative, meaning to admire
- *diligebam* from *diligo, diligere, dilexi, dilectus* is 1st singular
  imperfect active indicative, meaning to love.
- **ASK**. The way I have it written now, Pliny seems to be in an illicit
  relationship with this man.

    Nevertheless he ought to be sought and desired by us as an example of the
    previous age, in truth especially by me, who was loving as much as I was
    admiring that man not only publicly.

14. *primum quod utrique eadem regio, municipia finitima, agri etiam
    possessionesque coniunctae, praeterea quod ille mihi tutor relictus adfectum
    parentis exhibuit.*
15. *Sic candidatum me suffragio ornauit;*
16. *sic ad omnes honores meos ex secessibus accucurrit, cum iam pridem eiusmodi
    officiis renuntiasset;*
17. *sic illo die quo sacerdotes solent nominare quos dignissimos sacerdotio
    iudicant, me semper nominabat.*
18. *Quin etiam in hac nouissima ualetudine, ueritus ne forte inter quinqueuiros
    crearetur, qui minuendis publicis sumptibus iudicio senatus constituebantur,
    cum illi tot amici senes consularesque superessent, me huius aetatis per
    quem excusaretur elegit, his quidem uerbis:*
19. *'Etiam si filium haberem, tibi mandarem.'*

Quibus ex causis necesse est tamquam immaturam mortem eius in sinu tuo defleam,
si tamen fas est aut flere aut omnino mortem uocare, qua tanti uiri mortalitas
magis finita quam uita est. Viuit enim uiuetque semper, atque etiam latius in
memoria hominum et sermone uersabitur, postquam ab oculis recessit. Volo tibi
multa alia scribere, sed totus animus in hac una contemplatione defixus est.
Verginium cogito, Verginium uideo, Verginium iam uanis imaginibus, recentibus
tamen, audio adloquor teneo; cui fortasse ciues aliquos uirtutibus pares et
habemus et habebimus, gloria neminem. Vale.
