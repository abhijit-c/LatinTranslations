# (I) C. PLINIVS ROMANO SVO S.

1. *Post aliquot[^1] annos insigne atque etiam memorabile populi Romani oculis
   spectaculum exhibuit publicum funus[^2] Vergini Rufi[^3], maximi et
   clarissimi ciuis, perinde felicis.*

- *aliquot* is undeclined; here fitting on *annos* inside the *post*.
- *oculis* is a dative of indirect object.
- *exhibuit* from *exhibeo, exhibere, exhibui, exhibitus* is 3rd singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to present.
- *maximi et clarissimi ciuis* is a partitive genitive.

      After several years the public funeral of the equally fortunate Verinus
      Rufus, one of the greatest and brightest citizen, presented a conspicuous
      and even memorable spectacle to the eyes of the Roman people.

[^1]: **post aliquot annos:** i.e., it was several years since an occurance as
  memorable as that about to be mentioned. Verginius' death occured at the end
  of 97 AD.
[^2]: **publicum funus:** a signal honor, voted by the senate; the expense was
  defrayed sometimes by the public treasury, sometimes by voluntary
  contributions.
[^3]: **Vergini Rufi**: The 'grand old man' of that generation, consul for the
  third time in 97, as colleague of the emperor Nerva; he had been Pliny's
  guardian. **perinde felicis:** *not less fortunate*.

2. *Triginta annis[^4] gloriae suae superuixit; legit scripta de se carmina, legit
   historias[^5] et posteritati suae interfuit[^6].*

- *superuixit* from *supervivo, supervivere, supervixi* is 3rd singular perfect
  active indicative, meaning to survive. Takes the dative: *gloriae suae*.
- *legit* from *lego, legere, legi, lectus* is 3rd singular perfect active
  indicative, meaning to read.
- *scripta* from *scribo, scribere, scripsi, scriptus* is the p.p.p., meaning to
  write. This is modifying *carmina*.
- *interfuit* from *intersum, interesse* is 3rd singular perfect active
  indicative, meaning to take part in. Takes the dative *posteritati suae*.

    He survived his own glory within a period of 30 years; he read songs having
    been written about himself, he read histories and took part in his own
    legacies.

[^4]: **triginta annis:** ablative of duration of time, a construction which
  increases in frequency in the post-Augustan age. In both the elder and
  younger Pliny it almost entirely supplants the accusative of duration.
  **gloriae...supervixit:** *lived to enjoy his fame*.
[^5]: **historias:** in this connection it is intereting to read Ep. IX.19.
[^6]: **interfuit:** *learned the verdict of*.

3. *Perfunctus est tertio consulatu, ut summum fastigium priuati hominis
   impleret[^7], cum principis noluisset.*

- *perfunctus est* from *perfungor, perfungi, perfunctus sum* is 3rd singular
  perfect indicative, meaning to perform. This takes the ablative *tertio
  consulatu*.
- *impleret* from *impleo, implere, implevi, impletus* is 3rd singular imperfect
  active subjunctive, meaning to fulfill. This is a final clause.
- *noluisset* from *nolo, nolle, nolui* is 3rd singular pluperfect active
  subjunctive, meaning to wish not to.

    He performed a 3rd consulship, so that he might fulfill the highest honor of
    a private man, since he had not wanted the honor of the princeps.

[^7]: **fastigum...impleret:** a mixed metaphor. **privati hominis:** *of
  a subject*. **cum principis noluisset:** he had refused the purple after
  defeating Julius Vindex in 68, again after Galba's accession, the third time
  after Ortho's defeat at Bedriacum in 69. Juvenal VII.211, *quid enum Verginus
  armis. Debuit ulcisci magic, aut cum Vindice Galba.*

4. *Caesares[^8] quibus suspectus atque etiam inuisus uirtutibus[^9] fuerat
   euasit, reliquit incolumem optimum atque amicissimum, tamquam ad hunc ipsum
   honorem publici funeris reseruatus.*

- *quibus* is the dative of agent.
- *fuerat* is 3rd singular pluperfect active indicative.
- *suspectus fuerat* from *suspicio, suspicere, suspexi, suspectus* is 3rd
  singular pluperfect passive indicative, meaning to suspect.
- *inuisus fuerat* from *invideo, invidere, invidi, invisus* is 3rd singular
  pluperfect passive indicative, meaning to envy.
- *euasit* from *evado, evadere, evasi, evasus*is 3rd singular perfect active
  indicative, meaning to evade.
- *reliquit* from *relinquo, relinquere, reliqui, relictus* is 3rd singular
  perfect active indicative, meaning to leave behind.
- *reseruatus* from *reservo, reservare* is the perfect passive participle,
  meaning to reserve.

    He evaded the Caesars by whom he had been suspected and even envied for his
    virtues, he left behind safe the best and friendliest Caesar, as if he had
    been reserved to this very honor of a public funeral.

[^8]: **Caesares:** Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Domitian; the use of
  a personal direct object of *evadere* is noteworthy.
[^9]: **virtutibus:** causal. **optimum:** Nerva.

5. *Annum tertium et octogensimum excessit in altissima tranquillitate, pari
   ueneratione.*

- *excessit* from *excedo, excedere, excessi, excessus* is 3rd singular perfect
  active indicative, meaning to pass.
- *pari* from *par, paris*.

    He passed his 83rd year in the highest tranquility, with equal veneration.

6. *Usus est firma ualetudine, nisi quod solebant ei manus tremere, citra
   dolorem tamen.*

- *usus est* from *utor, uti, usus sum* is 3rd singular perfect indicative,
  meaning to use. This takes the ablative, which here is *firma ualetudine*.
- *solebant* from *soleo, solere, solitus sum* is 3rd plural imperfect active
  indicative, meaning to become accustomed to. This takes complimentary
  infinitve *tremere*.
- *tremere* from *tremo, tremere, tremui, -* is the present active infinitive,
  meaning to tremble.

    He enjoyed firm health, except that the hands for him were accustomed to
    tremble, yet short of pain.

7. *Aditus tantum mortis durior longiorque, sed hic ipse laudabilis.*

- Implied *erat*.

    Only the approach of death was harder and longer, but in this moment he
    himself was praiseworthy.

8. *Nam cum uocem praepararet acturus in consulatu principi gratias, liber quem
   forte acceperat grandiorem, et seni et stanti ipso pondere elapsus est.*

    The book, which quite big by chance he had grasped, slipped away because of
    its weight from both a man old and standing, when he was preparing his
    voice, going to give thanks, to the emperor in the consulate.

9. *Hunc dum sequitur colligitque, per leue et lubricum pauimentum fallente
   uestigio cecidit coxamque fregit, quae parum apte collocata reluctante aetate
   male coiit.*


Huius uiri exsequiae magnum ornamentum principi magnum saeculo magnum etiam foro
et rostris attulerunt. Laudatus est a consule Cornelio Tacito; nam hic supremus
felicitati eius cumulus accessit, laudator eloquentissimus. Et ille quidem
plenus annis ab√Æt, plenus honoribus, illis etiam quos recusauit: nobis tamen
quaerendus ac desiderandus est ut exemplar aeui prioris, mihi uero praecipue,
qui illum non solum publice quantum admirabar tantum diligebam; primum quod
utrique eadem regio, municipia finitima, agri etiam possessionesque
coniunctae, praeterea quod ille mihi tutor relictus adfectum parentis exhibuit.
Sic candidatum me suffragio ornauit; sic ad omnes honores meos ex secessibus
accucurrit, cum iam pridem eiusmodi officiis renuntiasset; sic illo die quo
sacerdotes solent nominare quos dignissimos sacerdotio iudicant, me semper
nominabat. Quin etiam in hac nouissima ualetudine, ueritus ne forte inter
quinqueuiros crearetur, qui minuendis publicis sumptibus iudicio senatus
constituebantur, cum illi tot amici senes consularesque superessent, me huius
aetatis per quem excusaretur elegit, his quidem uerbis: 'Etiam si filium
haberem, tibi mandarem.'

Quibus ex causis necesse est tamquam immaturam mortem eius in sinu tuo defleam,
si tamen fas est aut flere aut omnino mortem uocare, qua tanti uiri mortalitas
magis finita quam uita est. Viuit enim uiuetque semper, atque etiam latius in
memoria hominum et sermone uersabitur, postquam ab oculis recessit. Volo tibi
multa alia scribere, sed totus animus in hac una contemplatione defixus est.
Verginium cogito, Verginium uideo, Verginium iam uanis imaginibus, recentibus
tamen, audio adloquor teneo; cui fortasse ciues aliquos uirtutibus pares et
habemus et habebimus, gloria neminem. Vale.
