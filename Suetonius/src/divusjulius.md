## Chapter 31

```
Cum ergo sublatam tribunorum intercessionem ipsosque
urbe cessisse nuntiatum esset, praemissis confestim clam
cohortibus, ne qua suspicio moveretur, et spectaculo publico
per dissimulationem interfuit et formam, qua ludum gladia-
torium erat aedificaturus, consideravit et ex consuetudine
convivio se frequenti dedit. dein post solis occasum mulis
e proximo pistrino ad vehiculum iunctis occultissimum iter
modico comitatu ingressus est; et cum luminibus extinctis
decessisset via, diu errabundus tandem ad lucem duce
reperto per angustissimos tramites pedibus evasit. con-
secutusque cohortis ad Rubiconem flumen, qui provinciae
eius finis erat, paulum constitit, ac reputans quantum
moliretur, conversus ad proximps: 'etiam nunc', inquit,
'regredi possumus; quod si ponticulum transierimus, omnia
armis agenda erunt.'
```

- *clam* confirmed to be adverb via direct citation of quote in Lewis and Short.
- *si, nisi, num* and *ne*, all the *ali-* fall away: thus *ne qua = ne aliqua*.

Therefore when it was reported that the veto of the tribunes was raised and that
these very men had conceded from the city, with cohorts immediately having been
sent forward secretly, lest any suspicion is moved, and through dissimulation
he was present in a public spectacle and the model, by which Caesar was going to
build as school of gladiators, 

```
armis agenda erunt.' cunctanti ostentum tale factum est.
quidam eximia magnitudine et forma in proximo sedens
repente apparuit harundine canens; ad quem audiendum
cum praeter pastores plurimi etiam ex stationibus milites
concurrissent interque eos et aeneatores, rapta ab uno tuba
prosilivit ad flumen et ingenti spiritu classicum exorsus
pertendit ad alteram ripam. tunc Caesar: 'eatur', inquit,
'quo deorum ostenta et inimicorum iniquitas vocat. iacta
alea est inquit.
```

## Chapter 32

```
cunctanti ostentum tale factum est. 
```

- Got *ostentum* as 'portent' from the translation, because I'm weak.

      with such a thing delaying, a portent was made.

```
quidam eximia magnitudine et forma in proximo sedens repente apparuit harundine
canens; 
```

- Translating *in proximo* as 'nearby'.

      a certain person with extrodinary size and form, sitting nearby, singing
      with a reed, suddently appeared;

```
ad quem audiendum cum praeter pastores plurimi etiam ex stationibus milites
concurrissent interque eos et aeneatores, rapta ab uno tuba prosiliuit ad flumen
et ingenti spiritu classicum exorsus pertendit ad alteram ripam. 
```

      When, not only the shepherds, but a number of soldiers also flocked from
      their posts to listen to him, and some trumpeters among them, he snatched
      a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it, and sounding the advance
      with a piercing blast, crossed to the other side.

```
tunc Caesar: 'eatur,' inquit, 'quo deorum ostenta et inimicorum iniquitas uocat. 
```

      Then Caesar said 'The die is cast, he summons

```
iacta alea est,' inquit.
```

## Chapter 37

```
Confectis bellis quinquiens triumphauit, post deuictum Scipionem quater eodem
mense, sed interiectis diebus, et rursus semel post superatos Pompei liberos.
```
```
primum et excellentissimum triumphum egit Gallicum, sequentem Alexandrinum,
deinde Ponticum, huic proximum Africanum, nouissimum Hispaniensem, diuerso
quemque apparatu et instrumento.
```

```
Gallici triumphi die Velabrum praeteruehens paene curru excussus est axe
diffracto ascenditque Capitolium ad lumina quadraginta elephantis dextra
sinistraque lychnuchos gestantibus. 
```
```
Pontico triumpho inter pompae fercula trium
uerborum praetulit titulum “veni” · vidi · vici non acta belli significantem
sicut ceteris, sed celeriter confecti notam.
```

# Chapter 40

```
Conuersus hinc ad ordinandum rei publicae statum fastos correxit iam pridem uitio pontificum per
intercalandi licentiam adeo turbatos, ut neque messium feriae aestate neque uindemiarum autumno
conpeterent; 
```

- *res publica* is an idiom meaning 'the state'.
- What *iam pridem* is modifying is up to debate of interpretation of what Suetonius is emphasizing.

      from here, having turned to ordering the position of the state, he corrected the calendar,
      long ago having been disturbed to such a point through the freedom of intercalating by the
      crime of the pontiffs, so that neither the festivals of the harvests coincides with the summer
      nor the festivals of grapes in the autumn;

```
annumque ad cursum solis accommodauit, ut trecentorum sexaginta quinque dierum esset et intercalario
mense sublato unus dies quarto quoque anno intercalaretur.
```

      and he adapted the year to the course of the sun, so that there was 365 of days and, with the
      intercalary month having been lifted, one day was inserted in each fourth year.

```
quo autem magis in posterum ex Kalendis Ianuariis nouis temporum ratio congrueret, inter Nouembrem
ac Decembrem mensem interiecit duos alios; 
```

      but so that the account of the seasons in the future may more nearly coincide from the new
      January kalends, he inserted two others in between the November and December month;

```
fuitque is annus, quo haec constituebantur, quindecim mensium cum intercalario, qui ex consuetudine
in eum annum inciderat.
```

- Accusative of duraation of time.

      and that year, in which these things were set up, was 15 months long with the intercalary
      month, which out of custom had happened in that year.

# Chapter 45

```
Fuisse traditur excelsa statura, colore candido, teretibus membris, ore paulo pleniore, nigris
uegetisque oculis, ualitudine prospera, nisi quod tempore extremo repente animo linqui atque etiam
per somnum exterreri solebat. 
```

It is said that he was tall, of a fair complexion, round limbed, rather full faced, with eyes black
and piercing; and that he enjoyed excellent health, except towards the close of his life, when he
was subject to sudden fainting-fits, and disturbance in his sleep.


```
comitiali quoque morbo bis inter res agendas correptus est. 
```

He was likewise twice seized with the falling sickness while engaged in active service.

```
circa corporis curam morosior, ut non solum tonderetur diligenter ac raderetur, sed uelleretur
etiam, ut quidam exprobrauerunt, caluitii uero deformitatem iniquissime ferret saepe obtrectatorum
iocis obnoxiam expertus. 
```

He was so nice in the care of his person, that he not only kept the hair of his head closely cut and
had his face smoothly shaved, but even caused the hair on other parts of the body to be plucked out
by the roots, a practice for which some persons rallied him.

```
ideoque et deficientem capillum reuocare a uertice adsueuerat et ex omnibus
decretis sibi a senatu populoque honoribus non aliud aut recepit aut usurpauit libentius quam ius
laureae coronae perpetuo gestandae. 
```

```
Etiam cultu notabilem ferunt: usum enim lato clauo ad manus fimbriato nec umquam aliter quam ut
super eum cingeretur, et quidem fluxiore cinctura; unde emanasse Sullae dictum optimates saepius
admonentis, ut male praecinctum puerum cauerent.
```

It is said that he was particular in his dress. For he used the Latus Clavus1 with
fringes about the wrists, and always had it girded about him, but rather loosely. This circumstance
gave origin to the expression of Sylla, who often advised the nobles to beware of "the ill-girt
boy."
