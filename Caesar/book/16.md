# Section 16

1. *Natio est omnium Gallorum admodum dedita religionibus,*

   The people of all of Gaul are very devoted to religion,

2. *atque ob eam causam qui sunt adfecti gravioribus morbis quique in proliis
   periculisque versantur aut pro victimis homines immolant aut se immolaturos
   vovent, administrisque ad ea sacrifica Druidibus utuntur;*

   and on account of this reason those who are afflicted with more severe
   diseases and to those who are engaged in battle and danger either they
   sacrifice humans for the victims or vow that they are going to sacrifice
   themselves, and they use the druids as ministers for these sacrifices;

3. *quod, pro vita hominis nisi hominis vita reddatur, non posse deorum
   immortalium numen placari arbitrantur, publiceque eiusdem generis habent
   instituta sacrifica.*

   Because, unless the life of a man should be returned for the life of a man,
   they do think that the divine will of the immortal gods is not able to be
   placated, and in the name of the state they have instituted sacrifices of the
   same kind.

4. *Alii immani magnitudine simulacra habent, quorum contexta viminibus membra
   vivis hominibus complent; quibus succensis circumventi flamma exanimantur
   homines.*

   Some have images of enormous size, of whose limbs, woven from twigs, they
   fill it with alive humans; after these images have been set on fire the men
   are killed having been surrounded by fire.

5. *Supplicia eorum qui in furto aut in latrocinio aut aliqua noxia sint
   comprehensi gratiora dis immortalibus esse arbitrantur, sed, cum eius generis
   copia defecit, etiam ad innocentium supplicia descedunt.*

   They think that the punishments of those of the sort who have been caught in
   theft and robbery or in some other crime are deemed to be more satifying to
   the immortal gods.  But when the supply of this type is lacking, they resort
   even to the punishment of the innocent.
