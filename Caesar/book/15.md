# Section 15

1. Alterum genus est equitum. Hi, cum est usus atque aliquid bellum incidit
   (quod fere ante Caesaris adventum quot annis accidere solebat, uti aut ipsi
   iniurias inferrent aut inlatas propulsarent), omnes in bello versantur;

   The other kind is knights. These men, whenever needed and some war broke out
   (which was becoming in habit to happen almost every year before Caesar
   arrived, in order that they might either themselves inflict injuries or
   repulse that having been inflicted), all engaged in war;

2. atque eorum ut quisque est genere copiisque amplissimus, ita plurimos circum
   se ambactos clientesque habet. Hanc unam gratiam potentiamque noverunt.

   and as each of them is the most distinguished with respect to birth and
   supplies, thus he has the most vassals and clients around him. They knew
   this influence and power alone.
