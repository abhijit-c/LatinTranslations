# Section 20

1. *Quae civitates commodius suam rem publicam administrare existimantur habent
   legibus sanctum, si quis quid de re publica a finitimis rumore aut fama
   acceperit, uti ad magistratum deferat neve cum quo alio communicet:*

   The states that are thought to administrate their republic more efficiently
   have it established by law, if anyone who will have heard from the
   neighboring republic by means of rumor or report, that he may bring it to the
   magistrate and that he may not share it with who else:

   acceperit is either perfect subjunctive or future perfect indicative. Both
   verbs in prodasis are present subjunctive. Is this just a piece of a future
   more vivid clause?

2. *quod saepe homines temerarios atque imperitos falsis rumoribus terreri et ad
   facinus impelli et de summis rebus consilium capere cognitum est.*

   because it is known that rash and ignorant humans are often terrified by
   false reports and are driven to crime and seize a plan concerning the highest
   things.

3. *Magistratus quae visa sunt occultant, quaeque esse ex usu iudicaverunt
   multitudini produnt. De re publica nisi per concilium loqui non conceditur.*

   The magistrates hide , and they record what has been judged is in the
   interest of the people.
   Concerning the republic, except through assembly it is not allowed to speak.
