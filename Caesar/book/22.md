# Section 22

1. *Agri culturae non student, maiorque pars eorum victus in lacte, caseo, carne
   consistit.*

   They hold no eagerness for agriculture, and the greater part of their food
   stands in milk, cheese, and meat.

2. *Neque quisquam agri modum certum aut fines habet proprios; sed magistratus ac
   principes in annos singulos gentibus cognationibusque hominum, qui una
   coierunt, quantum et quo loco visum est agri attribuunt atque anno post alio
   transire cogunt.*

   and nobody has a fixed amount of land or of one's own territory; but the
   magistrates and the leaders every year assign to the clans and families of
   humans, who have assembled together, how much of the land and which place
   seems best and after one year they compel them to move elsewhere.

3. *Eius rei multas adferunt causas: ne assidua consuetudine capti studium belli
   gerendi agri cultura commutent; ne latos fines parare studeant,
   potentioresque humiliores possessionibus expellant; ne accuratius ad frigora
   atque aestus vitandos aedificent; ne qua oriatur pecuniae cupiditas, qua ex
   re factiones dissensionesque nascuntur;*

   They bring many reasons of that thing: 
   so that they may not exchange the zeal of waging war with agriculture
   captured with the constant cutsom; 
   so that they may not desire to acquire wide borders, and so that the powerful
   may not expel the weak from their possessions; 
   so that they may not build more carefully for the sake of avoiding the cold
   and heat;
   so that the desire of money may not begin, out of which thing factions and
   dispute is born;

4. *ut animi aequitate plebum contineant, cum suas quisque opes cum
   potentissimis aequari videat.*

   so that they may keep that of the common people by justice of mind, since
   each man sees that his own power is made equal with the most poweful.
